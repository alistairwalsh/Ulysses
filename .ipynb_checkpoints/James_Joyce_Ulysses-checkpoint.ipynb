tripping and sunny like the buck himself.\\nwe must go to athens. will you come if i can get the aunt to fork out\\ntwenty quid?\\n\\nhe laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:\\n\\n--will he come? the jejune jesuit!\\n\\nceasing, he began to shave with care.\\n\\n--tell me, mulligan, stephen said quietly.\\n\\n--yes, my love?\\n\\n--how long is haines going to stay in this tower?\\n\\nbuck mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.\\n\\n--god, isn\\'t he dreadful? he said frankly. a ponderous saxon. he thinks\\nyou\\'re not a gentleman. god, these bloody english! bursting with money\\nand indigestion. because he comes from oxford. you know, dedalus, you\\nhave the real oxford manner. he can\\'t make you out. o, my name for you\\nis the best: kinch, the knife-blade.\\n\\nhe shaved warily over his chin.\\n\\n--he was raving all night about a black panther, stephen said. where is\\nhis guncase?\\n\\n--a woful lunatic! mulligan said. were you in a funk?\\n\\n--i was, stephen said with energy and growing fear. out here in the dark\\nwith a man i don\\'t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a\\nblack panther. you saved men from drowning. i\\'m not a hero, however. if\\nhe stays on here i am off.\\n\\nbuck mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. he hopped down\\nfrom his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.\\n\\n--scutter! he cried thickly.\\n\\nhe came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into stephen\\'s upper\\npocket, said:\\n\\n--lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.\\n\\nstephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a\\ndirty crumpled handkerchief. buck mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.\\nthen, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:\\n\\n--the bard\\'s noserag! a new art colour for our irish poets: snotgreen.\\nyou can almost taste it, can\\'t you?\\n\\nhe mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over dublin bay, his fair\\noakpale hair stirring slightly.\\n\\n--god! he said quietly. isn\\'t the sea what algy calls it: a grey\\nsweet mother? the snotgreen sea. the scrotumtightening sea. _epi oinopa\\nponton_. ah, dedalus, the greeks! i must teach you. you must read them\\nin the original. _thalatta! thalatta_! she is our great sweet mother.\\ncome and look.\\n\\nstephen stood up and went over to the parapet. leaning on it he looked\\ndown on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of\\nkingstown.\\n\\n--our mighty mother! buck mulligan said.\\n\\nhe turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to stephen\\'s\\nface.\\n\\n--the aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. that\\'s why she won\\'t\\nlet me have anything to do with you.\\n\\n--someone killed her, stephen said gloomily.\\n\\n--you could have knelt down, damn it, kinch, when your dying mother\\nasked you, buck mulligan said. i\\'m hyperborean as much as you. but to\\nthink of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and\\npray for her. and you refused. there is something sinister in you...\\n\\nhe broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. a tolerant\\nsmile curled his lips.\\n\\n--but a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. kinch, the loveliest\\nmummer of them all!\\n\\nhe shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.\\n\\nstephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against\\nhis brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.\\npain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. silently, in\\na dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its\\nloose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her\\nbreath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of\\nwetted ashes. across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a\\ngreat sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. the ring of bay\\nand skyline held a dull green mass of liquid. a bowl of white china had\\nstood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had\\ntorn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.\\n\\nbuck mulligan wiped again his razorblade.\\n\\n--ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. i must give you a shirt\\nand a few noserags. how are the secondhand breeks?\\n\\n--they fit well enough, stephen answered.\\n\\nbuck mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.\\n\\n--the mockery of it, he said contentedly. secondleg they should be. god\\nknows what poxy bowsy left them off. i have a lovely pair with a hair\\nstripe, grey. you\\'ll look spiffing in them. i\\'m not joking, kinch. you\\nlook damn well when you\\'re dressed.\\n\\n--thanks, stephen said. i can\\'t wear them if they are grey.\\n\\n--he can\\'t wear them, buck mulligan told his face in the mirror.\\netiquette is etiquette. he kills his mother but he can\\'t wear grey\\ntrousers.\\n\\nhe folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the\\nsmooth skin.\\n\\nstephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its\\nsmokeblue mobile eyes.\\n\\n--that fellow i was with in the ship last night, said buck mulligan,\\nsays you have g.p.i. he\\'s up in dottyville with connolly norman. general\\nparalysis of the insane!\\n\\nhe swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad\\nin sunlight now radiant on the sea. his curling shaven lips laughed and\\nthe edges of his white glittering teeth. laughter seized all his strong\\nwellknit trunk.\\n\\n--look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!\\n\\nstephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by\\na crooked crack. hair on end. as he and others see me. who chose this\\nface for me? this dogsbody to rid of vermin. it asks me too.\\n\\n--i pinched it out of the skivvy\\'s room, buck mulligan said. it does her\\nall right. the aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for malachi. lead\\nhim not into temptation. and her name is ursula.\\n\\nlaughing again, he brought the mirror away from stephen\\'s peering eyes.\\n\\n--the rage of caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. if\\nwilde were only alive to see you!\\n\\ndrawing back and pointing, stephen said with bitterness:\\n\\n--it is a symbol of irish art. the cracked looking-glass of a servant.\\n\\nbuck mulligan suddenly linked his arm in stephen\\'s and walked with him\\nround the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he\\nhad thrust them.\\n\\n--it\\'s not fair to tease you like that, kinch, is it? he said kindly.\\ngod knows you have more spirit than any of them.\\n\\nparried again. he fears the lancet of my art as i fear that of his. the\\ncold steelpen.\\n\\n--cracked lookingglass of a servant! tell that to the oxy chap\\ndownstairs and touch him for a guinea. he\\'s stinking with money and\\nthinks you\\'re not a gentleman. his old fellow made his tin by selling\\njalap to zulus or some bloody swindle or other. god, kinch, if you and i\\ncould only work together we might do something for the island. hellenise\\nit.\\n\\ncranly\\'s arm. his arm.\\n\\n--and to think of your having to beg from these swine. i\\'m the only one\\nthat knows what you are. why don\\'t you trust me more? what have you\\nup your nose against me? is it haines? if he makes any noise here i\\'ll\\nbring down seymour and we\\'ll give him a ragging worse than they gave\\nclive kempthorpe.\\n\\nyoung shouts of moneyed voices in clive kempthorpe\\'s rooms. palefaces:\\nthey hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. o, i shall\\nexpire! break the news to her gently, aubrey! i shall die! with slit\\nribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the\\ntable, with trousers down at heels, chased by ades of magdalen with the\\ntailor\\'s shears. a scared calf\\'s face gilded with marmalade. i don\\'t\\nwant to be debagged! don\\'t you play the giddy ox with me!\\n\\nshouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. a deaf\\ngardener, aproned, masked with matthew arnold\\'s face, pushes his mower\\non the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.\\n\\nto ourselves... new paganism... omphalos.\\n\\n--let him stay, stephen said. there\\'s nothing wrong with him except at\\nnight.\\n\\n--then what is it? buck mulligan asked impatiently. cough it up. i\\'m\\nquite frank with you. what have you against me now?\\n\\nthey halted, looking towards the blunt cape of bray head that lay on the\\nwater like the snout of a sleeping whale. stephen freed his arm quietly.\\n\\n--do you wish me to tell you? he asked.\\n\\n--yes, what is it? buck mulligan answered. i don\\'t remember anything.\\n\\nhe looked in stephen\\'s face as he spoke. a light wind passed his brow,\\nfanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of\\nanxiety in his eyes.\\n\\nstephen, depressed by his own voice, said:\\n\\n--do you remember the first day i went to your house after my mother\\'s\\ndeath?\\n\\nbuck mulligan frowned quickly and said:\\n\\n--what? where? i can\\'t remember anything. i remember only ideas and\\nsensations. why? what happened in the name of god?\\n\\n--you were making tea, stephen said, and went across the landing to\\nget more hot water. your mother and some visitor came out of the\\ndrawingroom. she asked you who was in your room.\\n\\n--yes? buck mulligan said. what did i say? i forget.\\n\\n--you said, stephen answered, _o, it\\'s only dedalus whose mother is\\nbeastly dead._\\n\\na flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to buck\\nmulligan\\'s cheek.\\n\\n--did i say that? he asked. well? what harm is that?\\n\\nhe shook his constraint from him nervously.\\n\\n--and what is death, he asked, your mother\\'s or yours or my own? you\\nsaw only your mother die. i see them pop off every day in the mater and\\nrichmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. it\\'s a beastly\\nthing and nothing else. it simply doesn\\'t matter. you wouldn\\'t kneel\\ndown to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. why?\\nbecause you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it\\'s injected the\\nwrong way. to me it\\'s all a mockery and beastly. her cerebral lobes\\nare not functioning. she calls the doctor sir peter teazle and picks\\nbuttercups off the quilt. humour her till it\\'s over. you crossed her\\nlast wish in death and yet you sulk with me because i don\\'t whinge like\\nsome hired mute from lalouette\\'s. absurd! i suppose i did say it. i\\ndidn\\'t mean to offend the memory of your mother.\\n\\nhe had spoken himself into boldness. stephen, shielding the gaping\\nwounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:\\n\\n--i am not thinking of the offence to my mother.\\n\\n--of what then? buck mulligan asked.\\n\\n--of the offence to me, stephen answered.\\n\\nbuck mulligan swung round on his heel.\\n\\n--o, an impossible person! he exclaimed.\\n\\nhe walked off quickly round the parapet. stephen stood at his post,\\ngazing over the calm sea towards the headland. sea and headland now grew\\ndim. pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt\\nthe fever of his cheeks.\\n\\na voice within the tower called loudly:\\n\\n--are you up there, mulligan?\\n\\n--i\\'m coming, buck mulligan answered.\\n\\nhe turned towards stephen and said:\\n\\n--look at the sea. what does it care about offences? chuck loyola,\\nkinch, and come on down. the sassenach wants his morning rashers.\\n\\nhis head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level\\nwith the roof:\\n\\n--don\\'t mope over it all day, he said. i\\'m inconsequent. give up the\\nmoody brooding.\\n\\nhis head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of\\nthe stairhead:\\n\\n     _and no more turn aside and brood\\n     upon love\\'s bitter mystery\\n     for fergus rules the brazen cars._\\n\\n\\nwoodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the\\nstairhead seaward where he gazed. inshore and farther out the mirror of\\nwater whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. white breast of\\nthe dim sea. the twining stresses, two by two. a hand plucking the\\nharpstrings, merging their twining chords. wavewhite wedded words\\nshimmering on the dim tide.\\n\\na cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in\\ndeeper green. it lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. fergus\\' song:\\ni sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords. her\\ndoor was open: she wanted to hear my music. silent with awe and pity\\ni went to her bedside. she was crying in her wretched bed. for those\\nwords, stephen: love\\'s bitter mystery.\\n\\nwhere now?\\n\\nher secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk,\\na gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. a birdcage hung in the sunny\\nwindow of her house when she was a girl. she heard old royce sing in the\\npantomime of turko the terrible and laughed with others when he sang:\\n\\n     _i am the boy\\n     that can enjoy\\n     invisibility._\\n\\n\\nphantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.\\n\\n_and no more turn aside and brood._\\n\\n\\nfolded away in the memory of nature with her toys. memories beset his\\nbrooding brain. her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had\\napproached the sacrament. a cored apple, filled with brown sugar,\\nroasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. her shapely\\nfingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children\\'s\\nshirts.\\n\\nin a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its\\nloose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath,\\nbent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.\\n\\nher glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. on me\\nalone. the ghostcandle to light her agony. ghostly light on the tortured\\nface. her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on\\ntheir knees. her eyes on me to strike me down. _liliata rutilantium te\\nconfessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat._\\n\\nghoul! chewer of corpses!\\n\\nno, mother! let me be and let me live.\\n\\n--kinch ahoy!\\n\\nbuck mulligan\\'s voice sang from within the tower. it came nearer up the\\nstaircase, calling again. stephen, still trembling at his soul\\'s cry,\\nheard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.\\n\\n--dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. breakfast is ready. haines is\\napologising for waking us last night. it\\'s all right.\\n\\n--i\\'m coming, stephen said, turning.\\n\\n--do, for jesus\\' sake, buck mulligan said. for my sake and for all our\\nsakes.\\n\\nhis head disappeared and reappeared.\\n\\n--i told him your symbol of irish art. he says it\\'s very clever. touch\\nhim for a quid, will you? a guinea, i mean.\\n\\n--i get paid this morning, stephen said.\\n\\n--the school kip? buck mulligan said. how much? four quid? lend us one.\\n\\n--if you want it, stephen said.\\n\\n--four shining sovereigns, buck mulligan cried with delight. we\\'ll\\nhave a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. four omnipotent\\nsovereigns.\\n\\nhe flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of\\ntune with a cockney accent:\\n\\n     _o, won\\'t we have a merry time,\\n     drinking whisky, beer and wine!\\n     on coronation,\\n     coronation day!\\n     o, won\\'t we have a merry time\\n     on coronation day!_\\n\\n\\nwarm sunshine merrying over the sea. the nickel shavingbowl shone,\\nforgotten, on the parapet. why should i bring it down? or leave it there\\nall day, forgotten friendship?\\n\\nhe went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,\\nsmelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.\\nso i carried the boat of incense then at clongowes. i am another now and\\nyet the same. a servant too. a server of a servant.\\n\\nin the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower buck mulligan\\'s gowned form\\nmoved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its\\nyellow glow. two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor\\nfrom the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of\\ncoalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.\\n\\n--we\\'ll be choked, buck mulligan said. haines, open that door, will you?\\n\\nstephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. a tall figure rose from the\\nhammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open\\nthe inner doors.\\n\\n--have you the key? a voice asked.\\n\\n--dedalus has it, buck mulligan said. janey mack, i\\'m choked!\\n\\nhe howled, without looking up from the fire:\\n\\n--kinch!\\n\\n--it\\'s in the lock, stephen said, coming forward.\\n\\nthe key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been\\nset ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. haines stood at the\\ndoorway, looking out. stephen haled his upended valise to the table and\\nsat down to wait. buck mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside\\nhim. then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set\\nthem down heavily and sighed with relief.\\n\\n--i\\'m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... but, hush! not a\\nword more on that subject! kinch, wake up! bread, butter, honey. haines,\\ncome in. the grub is ready. bless us, o lord, and these thy gifts.\\nwhere\\'s the sugar? o, jay, there\\'s no milk.\\n\\nstephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from\\nthe locker. buck mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.\\n\\n--what sort of a kip is this? he said. i told her to come after eight.\\n\\n--we can drink it black, stephen said thirstily. there\\'s a lemon in the\\nlocker.\\n\\n--o, damn you and your paris fads! buck mulligan said. i want sandycove\\nmilk.\\n\\nhaines came in from the doorway and said quietly:\\n\\n--that woman is coming up with the milk.\\n\\n--the blessings of god on you! buck mulligan cried, jumping up from his\\nchair. sit down. pour out the tea there. the sugar is in the bag. here,\\ni can\\'t go fumbling at the damned eggs.\\n\\nhe hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three\\nplates, saying:\\n\\n--_in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti._\\n\\nhaines sat down to pour out the tea.\\n\\n--i\\'m giving you two lumps each, he said. but, i say, mulligan, you do\\nmake strong tea, don\\'t you?\\n\\nbuck mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman\\'s\\nwheedling voice:\\n\\n--when i makes tea i makes tea, as old mother grogan said. and when i\\nmakes water i makes water.\\n\\n--by jove, it is tea, haines said.\\n\\nbuck mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:\\n\\n--_so i do, mrs cahill,_ says she. _begob, ma\\'am,_ says mrs cahill, _god\\nsend you don\\'t make them in the one pot._\\n\\nhe lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled\\non his knife.\\n\\n--that\\'s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, haines. five\\nlines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of\\ndundrum. printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.\\n\\nhe turned to stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his\\nbrows:\\n\\n--can you recall, brother, is mother grogan\\'s tea and water pot spoken\\nof in the mabinogion or is it in the upanishads?\\n\\n--i doubt it, said stephen gravely.\\n\\n--do you now? buck mulligan said in the same tone. your reasons, pray?\\n\\n--i fancy, stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the\\nmabinogion. mother grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of mary ann.\\n\\nbuck mulligan\\'s face smiled with delight.\\n\\n--charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth\\nand blinking his eyes pleasantly. do you think she was? quite charming!\\n\\nthen, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened\\nrasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:\\n\\n     _--for old mary ann\\n     she doesn\\'t care a damn.\\n     but, hising up her petticoats..._\\n\\n\\nhe crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.\\n\\nthe doorway was darkened by an entering form.\\n\\n--the milk, sir!\\n\\n--come in, ma\\'am, mulligan said. kinch, get the jug.\\n\\nan old woman came forward and stood by stephen\\'s elbow.\\n\\n--that\\'s a lovely morning, sir, she said. glory be to god.\\n\\n--to whom? mulligan said, glancing at her. ah, to be sure!\\n\\nstephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.\\n\\n--the islanders, mulligan said to haines casually, speak frequently of\\nthe collector of prepuces.\\n\\n--how much, sir? asked the old woman.\\n\\n--a quart, stephen said.\\n\\nhe watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white\\nmilk, not hers. old shrunken paps. she poured again a measureful and\\na tilly. old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe\\na messenger. she praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.\\ncrouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her\\ntoadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. they lowed\\nabout her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. silk of the kine and poor old\\nwoman, names given her in old times. a wandering crone, lowly form of\\nan immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common\\ncuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. to serve or to upbraid,\\nwhether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.\\n\\n--it is indeed, ma\\'am, buck mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.\\n\\n--taste it, sir, she said.\\n\\nhe drank at her bidding.\\n\\n--if we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat\\nloudly, we wouldn\\'t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten\\nguts. living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with\\ndust, horsedung and consumptives\\' spits.\\n\\n--are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.\\n\\n--i am, ma\\'am, buck mulligan answered.\\n\\n--look at that now, she said.\\n\\nstephen listened in scornful silence. she bows her old head to a voice\\nthat speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she\\nslights. to the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there\\nis of her but her woman\\'s unclean loins, of man\\'s flesh made not in\\ngod\\'s likeness, the serpent\\'s prey. and to the loud voice that now bids\\nher be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.\\n\\n--do you understand what he says? stephen asked her.\\n\\n--is it french you are talking, sir? the old woman said to haines.\\n\\nhaines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.\\n\\n--irish, buck mulligan said. is there gaelic on you?\\n\\n--i thought it was irish, she said, by the sound of it. are you from the\\nwest, sir?\\n\\n--i am an englishman, haines answered.\\n\\n--he\\'s english, buck mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak\\nirish in ireland.\\n\\n--sure we ought to, the old woman said, and i\\'m ashamed i don\\'t speak\\nthe language myself. i\\'m told it\\'s a grand language by them that knows.\\n\\n--grand is no name for it, said buck mulligan. wonderful entirely. fill\\nus out some more tea, kinch. would you like a cup, ma\\'am?\\n\\n--no, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the\\nmilkcan on her forearm and about to go.\\n\\nhaines said to her:\\n\\n--have you your bill? we had better pay her, mulligan, hadn\\'t we?\\n\\nstephen filled again the three cups.\\n\\n--bill, sir? she said, halting. well, it\\'s seven mornings a pint at\\ntwopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three\\nmornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. that\\'s a\\nshilling and one and two is two and two, sir.\\n\\nbuck mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly\\nbuttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his\\ntrouser pockets.\\n\\n--pay up and look pleasant, haines said to him, smiling.\\n\\nstephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the\\nthick rich milk. buck mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in\\nhis fingers and cried:\\n\\n--a miracle!\\n\\nhe passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:\\n\\n--ask nothing more of me, sweet. all i can give you i give.\\n\\nstephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.\\n\\n--we\\'ll owe twopence, he said.\\n\\n--time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. time enough. good\\nmorning, sir.\\n\\nshe curtseyed and went out, followed by buck mulligan\\'s tender chant:\\n\\n     _--heart of my heart, were it more,\\n     more would be laid at your feet._\\n\\n\\nhe turned to stephen and said:\\n\\n--seriously, dedalus. i\\'m stony. hurry out to your school kip and bring\\nus back some money. today the bards must drink and junket. ireland\\nexpects that every man this day will do his duty.\\n\\n--that reminds me, haines said, rising, that i have to visit your\\nnational library today.\\n\\n--our swim first, buck mulligan said.\\n\\nhe turned to stephen and asked blandly:\\n\\n--is this the day for your monthly wash, kinch?\\n\\nthen he said to haines:\\n\\n--the unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.\\n\\n--all ireland is washed by the gulfstream, stephen said as he let honey\\ntrickle over a slice of the loaf.\\n\\nhaines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the\\nloose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:\\n\\n--i intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.\\n\\nspeaking to me. they wash and tub and scrub. agenbite of inwit.\\nconscience. yet here\\'s a spot.\\n\\n--that one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol\\nof irish art is deuced good.\\n\\nbuck mulligan kicked stephen\\'s foot under the table and said with warmth\\nof tone:\\n\\n--wait till you hear him on hamlet, haines.\\n\\n--well, i mean it, haines said, still speaking to stephen. i was just\\nthinking of it when that poor old creature came in.\\n\\n--would i make any money by it? stephen asked.\\n\\nhaines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of\\nthe hammock, said:\\n\\n--i don\\'t know, i\\'m sure.\\n\\nhe strolled out to the doorway. buck mulligan bent across to stephen and\\nsaid with coarse vigour:\\n\\n--you put your hoof in it now. what did you say that for?\\n\\n--well? stephen said. the problem is to get money. from whom? from the\\nmilkwoman or from him. it\\'s a toss up, i think.\\n\\n--i blow him out about you, buck mulligan said, and then you come along\\nwith your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.\\n\\n--i see little hope, stephen said, from her or from him.\\n\\nbuck mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on stephen\\'s arm.\\n\\n--from me, kinch, he said.\\n\\nin a suddenly changed tone he added:\\n\\n--to tell you the god\\'s truth i think you\\'re right. damn all else they\\nare good for. why don\\'t you play them as i do? to hell with them all.\\nlet us get out of the kip.\\n\\nhe stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying\\nresignedly:\\n\\n--mulligan is stripped of his garments.\\n\\nhe emptied his pockets on to the table.\\n\\n--there\\'s your snotrag, he said.\\n\\nand putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them,\\nchiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. his hands plunged and\\nrummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. god,\\nwe\\'ll simply have to dress the character. i want puce gloves and\\ngreen boots. contradiction. do i contradict myself? very well then, i\\ncontradict myself. mercurial malachi. a limp black missile flew out of\\nhis talking hands.\\n\\n--and there\\'s your latin quarter hat, he said.\\n\\nstephen picked it up and put it on. haines called to them from the\\ndoorway:\\n\\n--are you coming, you fellows?\\n\\n--i\\'m ready, buck mulligan answered, going towards the door. come out,\\nkinch. you have eaten all we left, i suppose. resigned he passed out\\nwith grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:\\n\\n--and going forth he met butterly.\\n\\nstephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out\\nand, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and\\nlocked it. he put the huge key in his inner pocket.\\n\\nat the foot of the ladder buck mulligan asked:\\n\\n--did you bring the key?\\n\\n--i have it, stephen said, preceding them.\\n\\nhe walked on. behind him he heard buck mulligan club with his heavy\\nbathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.\\n\\n--down, sir! how dare you, sir!\\n\\nhaines asked:\\n\\n--do you pay rent for this tower?\\n\\n--twelve quid, buck mulligan said.\\n\\n--to the secretary of state for war, stephen added over his shoulder.\\n\\nthey halted while haines surveyed the tower and said at last:\\n\\n--rather bleak in wintertime, i should say. martello you call it?\\n\\n--billy pitt had them built, buck mulligan said, when the french were on\\nthe sea. but ours is the _omphalos_.\\n\\n--what is your idea of hamlet? haines asked stephen.\\n\\n--no, no, buck mulligan shouted in pain. i\\'m not equal to thomas aquinas\\nand the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. wait till i\\nhave a few pints in me first.\\n\\nhe turned to stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his\\nprimrose waistcoat:\\n\\n--you couldn\\'t manage it under three pints, kinch, could you?\\n\\n--it has waited so long, stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.\\n\\n--you pique my curiosity, haines said amiably. is it some paradox?\\n\\n--pooh! buck mulligan said. we have grown out of wilde and paradoxes.\\nit\\'s quite simple. he proves by algebra that hamlet\\'s grandson is\\nshakespeare\\'s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own\\nfather.\\n\\n--what? haines said, beginning to point at stephen. he himself?\\n\\nbuck mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in\\nloose laughter, said to stephen\\'s ear:\\n\\n--o, shade of kinch the elder! japhet in search of a father!\\n\\n--we\\'re always tired in the morning, stephen said to haines. and it is\\nrather long to tell.\\n\\nbuck mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.\\n\\n--the sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of dedalus, he said.\\n\\n--i mean to say, haines explained to stephen as they followed, this\\ntower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of elsinore. _that beetles\\no\\'er his base into the sea,_ isn\\'t it?\\n\\nbuck mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards stephen but did\\nnot speak. in the bright silent instant stephen saw his own image in\\ncheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.\\n\\n--it\\'s a wonderful tale, haines said, bringing them to halt again.\\n\\neyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.\\nthe seas\\' ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the\\nsmokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail\\ntacking by the muglins.\\n\\n--i read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.\\nthe father and the son idea. the son striving to be atoned with the\\nfather.\\n\\nbuck mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. he looked\\nat them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had\\nsuddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. he moved\\na doll\\'s head to and fro, the brims of his panama hat quivering, and\\nbegan to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:\\n\\n     _--i\\'m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.\\n     my mother\\'s a jew, my father\\'s a bird.\\n     with joseph the joiner i cannot agree.\\n     so here\\'s to disciples and calvary._\\n\\n\\nhe held up a forefinger of warning.\\n\\n     _--if anyone thinks that i amn\\'t divine\\n     he\\'ll get no free drinks when i\\'m making the wine\\n     but have to drink water and wish it were plain\\n     that i make when the wine becomes water again._\\n\\n\\nhe tugged swiftly at stephen\\'s ashplant in farewell and, running forward\\nto a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or\\nwings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:\\n\\n     _--goodbye, now, goodbye! write down all i said\\n     and tell tom, dick and harry i rose from the dead.\\n     what\\'s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly\\n     and olivet\\'s breezy... goodbye, now, goodbye!_\\n\\n\\nhe capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his\\nwinglike hands, leaping nimbly, mercury\\'s hat quivering in the fresh\\nwind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.\\n\\nhaines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside stephen and\\nsaid:\\n\\n--we oughtn\\'t to laugh, i suppose. he\\'s rather blasphemous. i\\'m not a\\nbeliever myself, that is to say. still his gaiety takes the harm out of\\nit somehow, doesn\\'t it? what did he call it? joseph the joiner?\\n\\n--the ballad of joking jesus, stephen answered.\\n\\n--o, haines said, you have heard it before?\\n\\n--three times a day, after meals, stephen said drily.\\n\\n--you\\'re not a believer, are you? haines asked. i mean, a believer in\\nthe narrow sense of the word. creation from nothing and miracles and a\\npersonal god.\\n\\n--there\\'s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, stephen said.\\n\\nhaines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a\\ngreen stone. he sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.\\n\\n--thank you, stephen said, taking a cigarette.\\n\\nhaines helped himself and snapped the case to. he put it back in his\\nsidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang\\nit open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk\\ntowards stephen in the shell of his hands.\\n\\n--yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. either you believe\\nor you don\\'t, isn\\'t it? personally i couldn\\'t stomach that idea of a\\npersonal god. you don\\'t stand for that, i suppose?\\n\\n--you behold in me, stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible\\nexample of free thought.\\n\\nhe walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his\\nside. its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.\\nmy familiar, after me, calling, steeeeeeeeeeeephen! a wavering line\\nalong the path. they will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.\\nhe wants that key. it is mine. i paid the rent. now i eat his salt\\nbread. give him the key too. all. he will ask for it. that was in his\\neyes.\\n\\n--after all, haines began...\\n\\nstephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not\\nall unkind.\\n\\n--after all, i should think you are able to free yourself. you are your\\nown master, it seems to me.\\n\\n--i am a servant of two masters, stephen said, an english and an\\nitalian.\\n\\n--italian? haines said.\\n\\na crazy queen, old and jealous. kneel down before me.\\n\\n--and a third, stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.\\n\\n--italian? haines said again. what do you mean?\\n\\n--the imperial british state, stephen answered, his colour rising, and\\nthe holy roman catholic and apostolic church.\\n\\nhaines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he\\nspoke.\\n\\n--i can quite understand that, he said calmly. an irishman must think\\nlike that, i daresay. we feel in england that we have treated you rather\\nunfairly. it seems history is to blame.\\n\\nthe proud potent titles clanged over stephen\\'s memory the triumph\\nof their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam\\necclesiam:_ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own\\nrare thoughts, a chemistry of stars. symbol of the apostles in the\\nmass for pope marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in\\naffirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church\\nmilitant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs. a horde of heresies\\nfleeing with mitres awry: photius and the brood of mockers of\\nwhom mulligan was one, and arius, warring his life long upon the\\nconsubstantiality of the son with the father, and valentine, spurning\\nchrist\\'s terrene body, and the subtle african heresiarch sabellius who\\nheld that the father was himself his own son. words mulligan had spoken\\na moment since in mockery to the stranger. idle mockery. the void\\nawaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a\\nworsting from those embattled angels of the church, michael\\'s host,\\nwho defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their\\nshields.\\n\\nhear, hear! prolonged applause. _zut! nom de dieu!_\\n\\n--of course i\\'m a britisher, haines\\'s voice said, and i feel as one. i\\ndon\\'t want to see my country fall into the hands of german jews either.\\nthat\\'s our national problem, i\\'m afraid, just now.\\n\\ntwo men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.\\n\\n--she\\'s making for bullock harbour.\\n\\nthe boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.\\n\\n--there\\'s five fathoms out there, he said. it\\'ll be swept up that way\\nwhen the tide comes in about one. it\\'s nine days today.\\n\\nthe man that was drowned. a sail veering about the blank bay waiting\\nfor a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face,\\nsaltwhite. here i am.\\n\\nthey followed the winding path down to the creek. buck mulligan stood on\\na stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder.\\na young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise\\nhis green legs in the deep jelly of the water.\\n\\n--is the brother with you, malachi?\\n\\n--down in westmeath. with the bannons.\\n\\n--still there?

auric egg of\\nrussell warned occultly. the movements which work revolutions in the\\nworld are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant\\'s heart on the\\nhillside. for them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the\\nliving mother. the rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the\\nsixshilling novel, the musichall song. france produces the finest flower\\nof corruption in mallarme but the desirable life is revealed only to the\\npoor of heart, the life of homer\\'s phaeacians.\\n\\nfrom these words mr best turned an unoffending face to stephen.\\n\\n--mallarme, don\\'t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose\\npoems stephen mackenna used to read to me in paris. the one about\\n_hamlet._ he says: _il se promene, lisant au livre de lui-meme_, don\\'t\\nyou know, _reading the book of himself_. he describes _hamlet_ given in\\na french town, don\\'t you know, a provincial town. they advertised it.\\n\\nhis free hand graciously wrote tiny

doubt, but\\ndistressingly shortsighted in some matters.\\n\\nsumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.\\n\\n--a deathsman of the soul robert greene called him, stephen said. not\\nfor nothing was he a butcher\\'s son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and\\nspitting in his palms. nine lives are taken off for his father\\'s one.\\nour father who art in purgatory. khaki hamlets don\\'t hesitate to\\nshoot. the bloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the\\nconcentration camp sung by mr swinburne.\\n\\ncranly, i his mute orderly, following battles from afar.\\n\\n_whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none but we had spared..._\\n\\nbetween the saxon smile and yankee yawp. the devil and the deep sea.\\n\\n--he will have it that _hamlet_ is a ghoststory, john eglinton said\\nfor mr best\\'s behoof. like the fat boy in pickwick he wants to make our\\nflesh creep.\\n\\n_list! list! o list!_\\n\\nmy flesh hears him: creeping, hears.\\n\\n_if thou didst ever..._\\n\\n--what is a ghost? stephen said with tingling energy. one who has faded\\ninto impalpability through death, through absence, through change of\\nmanners. elizabethan london lay as far from stratford as corrupt paris\\nlies from virgin dublin. who is the ghost from _limbo patrum_, returning\\nto the world that has forgotten him? who is king hamlet?\\n\\njohn eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.\\n\\nlifted.\\n\\n--it is this hour of a day in mid june, stephen said, begging with\\na swift glance their hearing. the flag is up on the playhouse by the\\nbankside. the bear sackerson growls in the pit near it, paris garden.\\ncanvasclimbers who sailed with drake chew their sausages among the\\ngroundlings.\\n\\nlocal colour. work in all you know. make them accomplices.\\n\\n--shakespeare has left the huguenot\\'s house in silver street and walks\\nby the swanmews along the riverbank. but he does not stay to feed the\\npen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes. the swan of avon\\nhas other thoughts.\\n\\ncomposition of place. ignatius loyola, make haste to help me!\\n\\n--the play begins. a player comes on under the shadow, made up in the\\ncastoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. it is the\\nghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is shakespeare who\\nhas studied _hamlet_ all the years of his life which were not vanity in\\norder to play the part of the spectre. he speaks the words to burbage,\\nthe young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth,\\ncalling him by a name:\\n\\n_hamlet, i am thy father\\'s spirit,_\\n\\nbidding him list. to a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince,\\nyoung hamlet and to the son of his body, hamnet shakespeare, who has\\ndied in stratford that his namesake may live for ever.\\n\\nis it possible that that player shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in\\nthe vesture of buried denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words\\nto his own son\\'s name (had hamnet shakespeare lived he would have been\\nprince hamlet\\'s twin), is it possible, i want to know, or probable that\\nhe did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you\\nare the dispossessed son: i am the murdered father: your mother is the\\nguilty queen, ann shakespeare, born hathaway?\\n\\n--but this prying into the family life of a great man, russell began\\nimpatiently.\\n\\nart thou there, truepenny?\\n\\n--interesting only to the parish clerk. i mean, we have the plays. i\\nmean when we read the poetry of _king lear_ what is it to us how the\\npoet lived? as for living our servants can do that for us, villiers de\\nl\\'isle has said. peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day,\\nthe poet\\'s

born.\\n\\n--she died, stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born. she\\nsaw him into and out of the world. she took his first embraces. she bore\\nhis children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed\\nwhen he lay on his deathbed.\\n\\nmother\\'s deathbed. candle. the sheeted mirror. who brought me into\\nthis world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers.

quickly and as best he could.\\n\\n--bosh! stephen said rudely. a man of genius makes no mistakes. his\\nerrors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.\\n\\nportals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian,\\nsoftcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.\\n\\n--a shrew, john eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of\\ndiscovery, one should imagine. what useful discovery did socrates learn\\nfrom xanthippe?\\n\\n--dialectic, stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts\\ninto the world. what he learnt from his other wife myrto (_absit\\nnomen!_), socratididion\\'s epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever\\nknow. but neither the midwife\\'s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him\\nfrom the archons of sinn fein and their naggin of hemlock.\\n\\n--but ann hathaway? mr best\\'s quiet voice said forgetfully. yes, we seem\\nto be forgetting her as shakespeare himself forgot her.\\n\\nhis look went from brooder\\'s beard to carper\\'s skull, to remind, to\\nchide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless\\nthough maligned.\\n\\n--he had a good groatsworth of wit, stephen said, and no truant memory.\\nhe carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to romeville whistling\\n_the girl i left behind me._ if the earthquake did not time it we should\\nknow where to place poor wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds,\\nthe studded bridle and her blue windows. that memory, _venus and\\nadonis_, lay in the bedchamber of every light-of-love in london.\\nis katharine the shrew illfavoured? hortensio calls her young and\\nbeautiful. do you think the writer of _antony and cleopatra_, a\\npassionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose\\nthe ugliest doxy in all warwickshire to lie withal? good: he left her\\nand gained the world of men. but his boywomen are the women of a boy.\\ntheir life, thought, speech are lent them by males. he chose badly? he\\nwas

blushing, his mask said:\\n\\n--mr dedalus, your views are most illuminating.\\n\\nhe creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a\\nchopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:\\n\\n--is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?\\n\\nalarmed face asks me. why did he come? courtesy or an inward light?\\n\\n--where there is a reconciliation, stephen said, there must have been\\nfirst a sundering.\\n\\n--yes.\\n\\nchristfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks,\\nfrom hue and cry. knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase. women\\nhe won to him, tender people, a whore of babylon, ladies of justices,\\nbully tapsters\\' wives. fox and geese. and in new place a slack\\ndishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as\\ncinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow\\ngrave and unforgiven.\\n\\n--yes. so you think...\\n\\nthe door closed behind the outgoer.\\n\\nrest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and\\nbrooding air.\\n\\na vestal\\'s lamp.\\n\\nhere he ponders things that were not: what caesar would have lived to do\\nhad he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of\\nthe possible as possible: things not known: what name achilles bore when\\nhe lived among women.\\n\\ncoffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.\\nthoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. and i heard the\\nvoice of that egyptian highpriest. _in painted chambers loaded with\\ntilebooks._\\n\\nthey are still. once quick in the brains of men. still: but an itch of\\ndeath is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak\\ntheir will.\\n\\n--certainly, john eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most\\nenigmatic. we know nothing but that he lived and suffered. not even so\\nmuch. others abide our question. a shadow hangs over all the rest.\\n\\n--but _hamlet_ is so personal, isn\\'t it? mr best pleaded. i mean, a kind\\nof private paper, don\\'t you know, of his private life. i mean, i don\\'t\\ncare a button, don\\'t you know, who is killed or who is guilty...\\n\\nhe rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his\\ndefiance. his private papers in the original. _ta an bad ar an tir. taim\\nin mo shagart_. put beurla on it, littlejohn.\\n\\nquoth littlejohn eglinton:\\n\\n--i was prepared for paradoxes from what malachi mulligan told us but\\ni may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that\\nshakespeare is hamlet you have a stern task before you.\\n\\nbear with me.\\n\\nstephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under\\nwrinkled brows. a basilisk. _e quando vede l\\'uomo l\\'attosca_. messer\\nbrunetto, i thank thee for the word.\\n\\n--as we, or mother dana, weave and unweave our bodies, stephen said,\\nfrom day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist\\nweave and unweave his image. and as the mole on my right breast is where\\nit was when i was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff\\ntime after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image\\nof the unliving son looks forth. in the intense instant of imagination,\\nwhen the mind, shelley says, is a fading coal, that which i was is that\\nwhich i am and that which in possibility i may come to be. so in the\\nfuture, the sister of the past, i may see myself as i sit here now but\\nby reflection from that which then i shall be.\\n\\ndrummond of hawthornden helped you at that stile.\\n\\n--yes, mr best said youngly. i feel hamlet quite young. the bitterness\\nmight be from the father but the passages with ophelia are surely from\\nthe son.\\n\\nhas the wrong sow by the lug. he is in my father. i am in his son.\\n\\n--that mole is the last to go, stephen said, laughing.\\n\\njohn eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.\\n\\n--if that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a\\ndrug in the market. the plays of shakespeare\\'s later years which renan\\nadmired so much breathe another spirit.\\n\\n--the spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.\\n\\n--there can be no reconciliation, stephen said, if there has not been a\\nsundering.\\n\\nsaid that.\\n\\n--if you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over\\nthe hell of time of _king lear, othello, hamlet, troilus and cressida,_\\nlook to see when and how the shadow lifts. what softens the heart of a\\nman, shipwrecked in storms dire, tried, like another ulysses, pericles,\\nprince of tyre?\\n\\nhead, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.\\n\\n--a child, a girl, placed in his arms, marina.\\n\\n--the leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant\\nquantity, john eglinton detected. the highroads are dreary but they lead\\nto the town.\\n\\ngood bacon: gone musty. shakespeare bacon\\'s wild oats. cypherjugglers\\ngoing the highroads. seekers on the great quest. what town, good\\nmasters? mummed in names: a. e., eon: magee, john eglinton. east of the\\nsun, west of the moon: _tir na n-og_. booted the twain and staved.\\n\\n_how many miles to dublin? three score and ten, sir. will we be there by\\ncandlelight?_\\n\\n--mr brandes accepts it, stephen said, as the first play of the closing\\nperiod.\\n\\n--does he? what does mr sidney lee, or mr simon lazarus as some aver his\\nname is, say of it?\\n\\n--marina, stephen said, a child of storm, miranda, a wonder, perdita,\\nthat which was lost. what was lost is given back to him: his daughter\\'s\\nchild. _my dearest wife_, pericles says, _was like this maid._ will any\\nman love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?\\n\\n--the art of being a grandfather, mr best gan murmur. _l\\'art d\\'etre\\ngrand_...\\n\\n--will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added,\\nanother image?\\n\\ndo you know what you are talking about? love, yes. word known to all\\nmen. amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus\\n...\\n\\n--his own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of\\nall experience, material and moral. such an appeal will touch him. the\\nimages of other males of his blood will repel him. he will see in them\\ngrotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself.\\n\\nthe benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.\\n\\n--i hope mr dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of\\nthe public. and we ought to mention another irish commentator, mr george\\nbernard shaw. nor should we forget mr frank harris. his articles on\\nshakespeare in the _saturday review_ were surely brilliant. oddly\\nenough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the\\nsonnets. the favoured rival is william herbert, earl of pembroke. i own\\nthat if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in\\nharmony with--what shall i say?--our notions of what ought not to have\\nbeen.\\n\\nfelicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk\\'s egg, prize\\nof their fray.\\n\\nhe thous and thees her with grave husbandwords. dost love, miriam? dost\\nlove thy man?\\n\\n--that may be too, stephen said. there\\'s a saying of goethe\\'s which mr\\nmagee likes to quote. beware of what you wish for in youth because\\nyou will get it in middle life. why does he send to one who is\\na _buonaroba,_ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a\\nscandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him? he was himself a lord\\nof language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written\\n_romeo and juliet_. why? belief in himself has been untimely killed. he\\nwas overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, i should say) and he will\\nnever be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game\\nof laugh and lie down. assumed dongiovannism will not save him. no later\\nundoing will undo the first undoing. the tusk of the boar has wounded\\nhim there where love lies ableeding. if the shrew is worsted yet there\\nremains to her woman\\'s invisible weapon. there is, i feel in the words,\\nsome goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow\\nof the first, darkening even his own understanding of himself. a like\\nfate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.\\n\\nthey list. and in the porches of their ears i pour.\\n\\n--the soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the\\nporch of a sleeping ear. but those who are done to death in sleep cannot\\nknow the manner of their quell unless their creator endow their souls\\nwith that knowledge in the life to come. the poisoning and the beast\\nwith two backs that urged it king hamlet\\'s ghost could not know of were\\nhe not endowed with knowledge by his creator. that is why the speech\\n(his lean unlovely english) is always turned elsewhere, backward.\\nravisher and ravished, what he would but would not, go with him from\\nlucrece\\'s bluecircled ivory globes to imogen\\'s breast, bare, with its\\nmole cinquespotted. he goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up\\nto hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore. but, because\\nloss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished\\npersonality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he\\nhas revealed. his beaver is up. he is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by\\nelsinore\\'s rocks or what you will, the sea\\'s voice, a voice heard\\nonly in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son\\nconsubstantial with the father.\\n\\n--amen! was responded from the doorway.\\n\\nhast thou found me, o mine enemy?\\n\\n_entr\\'acte_.\\n\\na ribald face, sullen as a dean\\'s, buck mulligan came forward, then\\nblithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles. my telegram.\\n\\n--you were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if i mistake not? he\\nasked of stephen.\\n\\nprimrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed panama as with a bauble.\\n\\nthey make him welcome. _was du verlachst wirst du noch dienen._\\n\\nbrood of mockers: photius, pseudomalachi, johann most.\\n\\nhe who himself begot middler the holy ghost and himself sent himself,\\nagenbuyer, between himself and others, who, put upon by his fiends,\\nstripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on\\ncrosstree, who let him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven\\nand there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of his\\nown self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead\\nwhen all the quick shall be dead already.\\n\\nglo--o--ri--a in ex--cel--sis de--o.\\n\\nhe lifts his hands. veils fall. o, flowers! bells with bells with bells\\naquiring.\\n\\n--yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. a most instructive discussion.\\nmr mulligan, i\\'ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of\\nshakespeare. all sides of life should be represented.\\n\\nhe smiled on all sides equally.\\n\\nbuck mulligan thought, puzzled:\\n\\n--shakespeare? he said. i seem to know the name.\\n\\na flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.\\n\\n--to be sure, he said, remembering brightly. the chap that writes like\\nsynge.\\n\\nmr best turned to him.\\n\\n--haines missed you, he said. did you meet him? he\\'ll see you after at\\nthe d. b. c. he\\'s gone to gill\\'s to buy hyde\\'s _lovesongs of connacht_.\\n\\n--i came through the museum, buck mulligan said. was he here?\\n\\n--the bard\\'s fellowcountrymen, john eglinton answered, are rather tired\\nperhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. i hear that an actress played\\nhamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in dublin. vining\\nheld that the prince was a woman. has no-one made him out to be an\\nirishman? judge barton, i believe, is searching for some clues. he\\nswears (his highness not his lordship) by saint patrick.\\n\\n--the most brilliant of all is that story of wilde\\'s, mr best said,\\nlifting his brilliant notebook. that _portrait of mr w. h._ where he\\nproves that the sonnets were written by a willie hughes, a man all hues.\\n\\n--for willie hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.\\n\\nor hughie wills? mr william himself. w. h.: who am i?\\n\\n--i mean, for willie hughes, mr best said, amending his gloss easily. of\\ncourse it\\'s all paradox, don\\'t you know, hughes and hews and hues,\\nthe colour, but it\\'s so typical the way he works it out. it\\'s the very\\nessence of wilde, don\\'t you know. the light touch.\\n\\nhis glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.\\ntame essence of wilde.\\n\\nyou\\'re darned witty. three drams of usquebaugh you drank with dan\\ndeasy\\'s ducats.\\n\\nhow much did i spend? o, a few shillings.\\n\\nfor a plump of pressmen. humour wet and dry.\\n\\nwit. you would give your five wits for youth\\'s proud livery he pranks\\nin. lineaments of gratified desire.\\n\\nthere be many mo. take her for me. in pairing time. jove, a cool ruttime\\nsend them. yea, turtledove her.\\n\\neve. naked wheatbellied sin. a snake coils her, fang in\\'s kiss.\\n\\n--do you think it is only a paradox? the quaker librarian was asking.\\nthe mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.\\n\\nthey talked seriously of mocker\\'s seriousness.\\n\\nbuck mulligan\\'s again heavy face eyed stephen awhile. then, his head\\nwagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. his\\nmobile lips read, smiling with new delight.\\n\\n--telegram! he said. wonderful inspiration! telegram! a papal bull!\\n\\nhe sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:\\n\\n--_the sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the\\nimmense debtorship for a thing done._ signed: dedalus. where did you\\nlaunch it from? the kips? no. college green. have you drunk the four\\nquid? the aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father. telegram!\\nmalachi mulligan, the ship, lower abbey street. o, you peerless mummer!\\no, you priestified kinchite!\\n\\njoyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a\\nquerulous brogue:\\n\\n--it\\'s what i\\'m telling you, mister honey, it\\'s queer and sick we were,\\nhaines and myself, the time himself brought it in. \\'twas murmur we did\\nfor a gallus potion would rouse a friar, i\\'m thinking, and he limp with\\nleching. and we one hour and two hours and three hours in connery\\'s\\nsitting civil waiting for pints apiece.\\n\\nhe wailed:\\n\\n--and we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your\\nconglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the\\ndrouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.\\n\\nstephen laughed.\\n\\nquickly, warningfully buck mulligan bent down.\\n\\n--the tramper synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you. he\\nheard you pissed on his halldoor in glasthule. he\\'s out in pampooties to\\nmurder you.\\n\\n--me! stephen exclaimed. that was your contribution to literature.\\n\\nbuck mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping\\nceiling.\\n\\n--murder you! he laughed.\\n\\nharsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash\\nof lights in rue saint-andre-des-arts. in words of words for words,\\npalabras. oisin with patrick. faunman he met in clamart woods,\\nbrandishing a winebottle. _c\\'est vendredi saint!_ murthering irish. his\\nimage, wandering, he met. i mine. i met a fool i\\'the forest.\\n\\n--mr lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.\\n\\n--... in which everyone can find his own. so mr justice madden in his\\n_diary of master william silence_ has found the hunting terms... yes?\\nwhat is it?\\n\\n--there\\'s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and\\noffering a card. from the _freeman._ he wants to see the files of the\\n_kilkenny people_ for last year.\\n\\n--certainly, certainly, certainly. is the gentleman?...\\n\\nhe took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked,\\nasked, creaked, asked:\\n\\n--is he?... o, there!\\n\\nbrisk in a galliard he was off, out. in the daylit corridor he talked\\nwith voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most\\nhonest broadbrim.\\n\\n--this gentleman? _freeman\\'s journal? kilkenny people?_ to be sure. good\\nday, sir. _kilkenny_... we have certainly...\\n\\na patient silhouette waited, listening.\\n\\n--all the leading provincial... _northern whig, cork examiner,\\nenniscorthy guardian,_ 1903... will you please?... evans, conduct this\\ngentleman... if you just follow the atten... or, please allow me...\\nthis way... please, sir...\\n\\nvoluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing\\ndark figure following his hasty heels.\\n\\nthe door closed.\\n\\n--the sheeny! buck mulligan cried.\\n\\nhe jumped up and snatched the card.\\n\\n--what\\'s his name? ikey moses? bloom.\\n\\nhe rattled on:\\n\\n--jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. i found him over in the\\nmuseum where i went to hail the foamborn aphrodite. the greek mouth that\\nhas never been twisted in prayer. every day we must do homage to her.\\n_life of life, thy lips enkindle._\\n\\nsuddenly he turned to stephen:\\n\\n--he knows you. he knows your old fellow. o, i fear me, he is greeker\\nthan the greeks. his pale galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.\\nvenus kallipyge. o, the thunder of those loins! _the god pursuing the\\nmaiden hid_.\\n\\n--we want to hear more, john eglinton decided with mr best\\'s approval.\\nwe begin to be interested in mrs s. till now we had thought of her, if\\nat all, as a patient griselda, a penelope stayathome.\\n\\n--antisthenes, pupil of gorgias, stephen said, took the palm of beauty\\nfrom kyrios menelaus\\' brooddam, argive helen, the wooden mare of troy\\nin whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor penelope. twenty\\nyears he lived in london and, during part of that time, he drew a salary\\nequal to that of the lord chancellor of ireland. his life was rich. his\\nart, more than the art of feudalism as walt whitman called it, is the\\nart of surfeit. hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar\\nof roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies. sir walter\\nraleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his\\nback including a pair of fancy stays. the gombeenwoman eliza tudor had\\nunderlinen enough to vie with her of sheba. twenty years he dallied\\nthere between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love\\nand its foul pleasures. you know manningham\\'s story of the burgher\\'s\\nwife who bade dick burbage to her bed after she had seen him in _richard\\niii_ and how shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing,\\ntook the cow by the horns and, when burbage came knocking at the gate,\\nanswered from the capon\\'s blankets: _william the conqueror came before\\nrichard iii_. and the gay lakin, mistress fitton, mount and cry o,\\nand his dainty birdsnies, lady penelope rich, a clean quality woman is\\nsuited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time.\\n\\ncours la reine. _encore vingt sous. nous ferons de petites cochonneries.\\nminette? tu veux?_\\n\\n--the height of fine society. and sir william davenant of oxford\\'s\\nmother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.\\n\\nbuck mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:\\n\\n--blessed margaret mary anycock!\\n\\n--and harry of six wives\\' daughter. and other lady friends from\\nneighbour seats as lawn tennyson, gentleman poet, sings. but all those\\ntwenty years what do you suppose poor penelope in stratford was doing\\nbehind the diamond panes?\\n\\ndo and do. thing done. in a rosery of fetter lane of gerard, herbalist,\\nhe walks, greyedauburn. an azured harebell like her veins. lids of\\njuno\\'s eyes, violets. he walks. one life is all. one body. do. but do.\\nafar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.\\n\\nbuck mulligan rapped john eglinton\\'s desk sharply.\\n\\n--whom do you suspect? he challenged.\\n\\n--say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. once spurned twice\\nspurned. but the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.\\n\\nlove that dare not speak its name.\\n\\n--as an englishman, you mean, john sturdy eglinton put in, he loved a\\nlord.\\n\\nold wall where sudden lizards flash. at charenton i watched them.\\n\\n--it seems so, stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all\\nother and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the\\nstallion. maybe, like socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a\\nshrew to wife. but she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow. two\\ndeeds are rank in that ghost\\'s mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained\\nyokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband\\'s brother. sweet\\nann, i take it, was hot in the blood. once a wooer, twice a wooer.\\n\\nstephen turned boldly in his chair.\\n\\n--the burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning. if you\\ndeny that in the fifth scene of _hamlet_ he has branded her with infamy\\ntell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years\\nbetween the day she married him and the day she buried him. all those\\nwomen saw their men down and under: mary, her goodman john, ann, her\\npoor dear willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the\\nfirst to go, joan, her four brothers, judith, her husband and all her\\nsons, susan, her husband too, while susan\\'s daughter, elizabeth, to use\\ngranddaddy\\'s words, wed her second, having killed her first.\\n\\no, yes, mention there is. in the years when he was living richly in\\nroyal london to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her\\nfather\\'s shepherd. explain you then. explain the swansong too wherein he\\nhas commended her to posterity.\\n\\nhe faced their silence.\\n\\n     to whom thus eglinton:\\n     you mean the will.\\n     but that has been explained, i believe, by jurists.\\n     she was entitled to her widow\\'s dower\\n     at common law. his legal knowledge was great\\n     our judges tell us.\\n     him satan fleers,\\n     mocker:\\n     and therefore he left out her name\\n     from the first draft but he did not leave out\\n     the presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters,\\n     for his sister, for his old cronies in stratford\\n     and in london. and therefore when he was urged,\\n     as i believe, to name her\\n     he left her his\\n     secondbest\\n     bed.\\n     _punkt._\\n     leftherhis\\n     secondbest\\n     leftherhis\\n     bestabed\\n     secabest\\n     leftabed.\\n\\n\\nwoa!\\n\\n--pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, john eglinton observed, as\\nthey have still if our peasant plays are true to type.\\n\\n--he was a rich country gentleman, stephen said, with a coat of arms\\nand landed estate at stratford and a house in ireland yard, a capitalist\\nshareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer. why did he not leave her\\nhis best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in\\npeace?\\n\\n--it is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, mr\\nsecondbest best said finely.\\n\\n--_separatio a mensa et a thalamo_, bettered buck mulligan and was\\nsmiled on.\\n\\n--antiquity mentions famous beds, second eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.\\nlet me think.\\n\\n--antiquity mentions that stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage,\\nstephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays\\ntribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his\\ndead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don\\'t forget\\nnell gwynn herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.\\n\\n--do you mean he died so? mr best asked with slight concern. i mean...\\n\\n--he died dead drunk, buck mulligan capped. a quart of ale is a dish for\\na king. o, i must tell you what dowden said!\\n\\n--what? asked besteglinton.\\n\\nwilliam shakespeare and company, limited. the people\\'s william. for\\nterms apply: e. dowden, highfield house...\\n\\n--lovely! buck mulligan suspired amorously. i asked him what he thought\\nof the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. he lifted his hands\\nand said: _all we can say is that life ran very high in those days._\\nlovely!\\n\\ncatamite.\\n\\n--the sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness best to\\nugling eglinton.\\n\\nsteadfast john replied severe:\\n\\n--the doctor can tell us what those words mean. you cannot eat your cake\\nand have it.\\n\\nsayest thou so? will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?\\n\\n--and the sense of property, stephen said. he drew shylock out of his\\nown long pocket. the son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself\\na cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the\\nfamine riots. his borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship\\nmentioned by chettle falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing.\\nhe sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted\\nhis pound of flesh in interest for every money lent. how else could\\naubrey\\'s ostler and callboy get rich quick? all events brought grist to\\nhis mill. shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging\\nand quartering of the queen\\'s leech lopez, his jew\\'s heart being plucked\\nforth while the sheeny was yet alive: _hamlet_ and _macbeth_ with\\nthe coming to the throne of a scotch philosophaster with a turn for\\nwitchroasting. the lost armada is his jeer in _love\\'s labour lost_.\\nhis pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of mafeking\\nenthusiasm. warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter\\'s theory\\nof equivocation. the _sea venture_ comes home from bermudas and the play\\nrenan admired is written with patsy caliban, our american cousin.\\nthe sugared sonnets follow sidney\\'s. as for fay elizabeth, otherwise\\ncarrotty bess, the gross virgin who inspired _the merry wives of\\nwindsor_, let some meinherr from almany grope his life long for deephid\\nmeanings in the depths of the buckbasket.\\n\\ni think you\\'re getting on very nicely. just mix up a mixture of\\ntheolologicophilolological. _mingo, minxi, mictum, mingere._\\n\\n--prove that he was a jew, john eglinton dared,\\'expectantly. your dean\\nof studies holds he was a holy roman.\\n\\n_sufflaminandus sum._\\n\\n--he was made in germany, stephen replied, as the champion french\\npolisher of italian scandals.\\n\\n--a myriadminded man, mr best reminded. coleridge called him\\nmyriadminded.\\n\\n_amplius. in societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia\\ninter multos._\\n\\n--saint thomas, stephen began...\\n\\n--_ora pro nobis_, monk mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.\\n\\nthere he keened a wailing rune.\\n\\n--_pogue mahone! acushla machree!_ it\\'s destroyed we are from this day!\\nit\\'s destroyed we are surely!\\n\\nall smiled their smiles.\\n\\n--saint thomas, stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works i enjoy\\nreading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different\\nfrom that of the new viennese school mr magee spoke of, likens it in his\\nwise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions. he means that the\\nlove so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some\\nstranger who, it may be, hungers for it. jews, whom christians tax with\\navarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage. accusations\\nare made in anger. the christian laws which built up the hoards of the\\njews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their\\naffections too with hoops of steel. whether these be sins or virtues old\\nnobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet. but a man who holds so tightly\\nto what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold\\ntightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his\\nwife. no sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his\\nmanservant or his maidservant or his jackass.\\n\\n--or his jennyass, buck mulligan antiphoned.\\n\\n--gentle will is being roughly handled, gentle mr best said gently.\\n\\n--which will? gagged sweetly buck mulligan. we are getting mixed.\\n\\n--the will to live, john eglinton philosophised, for poor ann, will\\'s\\nwidow, is the will to die.\\n\\n_--requiescat!_ stephen prayed.\\n\\n     _what of all the will to do?\\n     it has vanished long ago..._\\n\\n--she lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the\\nmobled queen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as\\nrare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven\\nparishes. in old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed with her\\nat new place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid for but in\\nwhich bed he slept it skills not to ask) and heard she had a soul. she\\nread or had read to her his chapbooks preferring them to the _merry\\nwives_ and, loosing her nightly waters on the jordan, she thought\\nover _hooks and eyes for believers\\' breeches_ and _the most spiritual\\nsnuffbox to make the most devout souls sneeze_. venus has twisted her\\nlips in prayer. agenbite of inwit: remorse of conscience. it is an age\\nof exhausted whoredom groping for its god.\\n\\n--history shows that to be true, _inquit eglintonus chronolologos_. the\\nages succeed one another. but we have it on high authority that a man\\'s\\nworst enemies shall be those of his own house and family. i feel that\\nrussell is right. what do we care for his wife or father? i should say\\nthat only family poets have family lives. falstaff was not a family man.\\ni feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation.\\n\\nlean, he lay back. shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid. shy, supping\\nwith the godless, he sneaks the cup. a sire in ultonian antrim bade it\\nhim. visits him here on quarter days. mr magee, sir, there\\'s a gentleman\\nto see you. me? says he\\'s your father, sir. give me my wordsworth. enter\\nmagee mor matthew, a rugged rough rugheaded kern, in strossers with\\na buttoned codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with clauber of ten\\nforests, a wand of wilding in his hand.\\n\\nyour own? he knows your old fellow. the widower.\\n\\nhurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay paris on the quayside i\\ntouched his hand. the voice, new warmth, speaking. dr bob kenny is\\nattending her. the eyes that wish me well. but do not know me.\\n\\n--a father, stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is a necessary\\nevil. he wrote the play in the months that followed his father\\'s death.\\nif you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters, with\\nthirtyfive years of life, _nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita_, with\\nfifty of experience, is the beardless undergraduate from wittenberg then\\nyou must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen. no.\\nthe corpse of john shakespeare does not walk the night. from hour to\\nhour it rots and rots. he rests, disarmed of fatherhood, having devised\\nthat mystical estate upon his son. boccaccio\\'s calandrino was the first\\nand last man who felt himself with child. fatherhood, in the sense of\\nconscious begetting, is unknown to man. it is a mystical estate, an\\napostolic succession, from only begetter to only begotten. on that\\nmystery and not on the madonna which the cunning italian intellect\\nflung to the mob of europe the church is founded and founded irremovably\\nbecause founded, like the world, macro and microcosm, upon the void.\\nupon incertitude, upon unlikelihood. _amor matris_, subjective and\\nobjective genitive, may be the only true thing in life. paternity may be\\na legal fiction. who is the father of any son that any son should love\\nhim or he any son?\\n\\nwhat the hell are you driving at?\\n\\ni know. shut up. blast you. i have reasons.\\n\\n_amplius. adhuc. iterum. postea._\\n\\nare you condemned to do this?\\n\\n--they are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminal\\nannals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities,\\nhardly record its breach. sons with mothers, sires with daughters,\\nlesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with\\ngrandmothers, jailbirds with keyholes, queens with prize bulls. the son\\nunborn mars beauty: born, he brings pain, divides affection, increases\\ncare. he is a new male: his growth is his father\\'s decline, his youth\\nhis father\\'s envy, his friend his father\\'s enemy.\\n\\nin rue monsieur-le-prince i thought it.\\n\\n--what links them in nature? an instant of blind rut.\\n\\nam i a father? if i were?\\n\\nshrunken uncertain hand.\\n\\n--sabellius, the african, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of the\\nfield, held that the father was himself his own son. the bulldog of\\naquin, with whom no word shall be impossible, refutes him. well: if\\nthe father who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a\\nfather be a son? when rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another poet\\nof the same name in the comedy of errors wrote _hamlet_ he was not the\\nfather of his own son merely but, being no more a son, he was and felt\\nhimself the father of all his race, the father of his own grandfather,\\nthe father of his unborn grandson who, by the same token, never was\\nborn, for nature, as mr magee understands her, abhors perfection.\\n\\neglintoneyes, quick with pleasure, looked up shybrightly. gladly\\nglancing, a merry puritan, through the twisted eglantine.\\n\\nflatter. rarely. but flatter.\\n\\n--himself his own father, sonmulligan told himself. wait. i am big with\\nchild. i have an unborn child in my brain. pallas athena! a play! the\\nplay\\'s the thing! let me parturiate!\\n\\nhe clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands.\\n\\n--as for his family, stephen said, his mother\\'s name lives in the\\nforest of arden. her death brought from him the scene with volumnia in\\n_coriolanus._ his boyson\\'s death is the deathscene of young arthur in\\n_king john._ hamlet, the black prince, is hamnet shakespeare. who the\\ngirls in _the tempest_, in _pericles,_ in _winter\\'s tale_ are we know.\\nwho cleopatra, fleshpot of egypt, and cressid and venus are we may\\nguess. but there is another member of his family who is recorded.\\n\\n--the plot thickens, john eglinton said.\\n\\nthe quaker librarian, quaking, tiptoed in, quake, his mask, quake, with\\nhaste, quake, quack.\\n\\ndoor closed. cell. day.\\n\\nthey list. three. they.\\n\\ni you he they.\\n\\ncome, mess.\\n\\nstephen: he had three brothers, gilbert, edmund, richard. gilbert in

on\\'s back. the playhouse sausage\\nfilled gilbert\\'s soul. he is nowhere: but an edmund and a richard are\\nrecorded in the works of sweet william.\\n\\nmageeglinjohn: names! what\\'s in a name?\\n\\nbest: that is my name, richard, don\\'t you know. i hope you are going to\\nsay a good word for richard, don\\'t you know, for my sake. _(laughter)_\\n\\n\\nbuckmulligan: (_piano,

lear_, two bear the wicked uncles\\'\\nnames. nay, that last play was written or being written while his\\nbrother edmund lay dying in southwark.\\n\\nbest: i hope edmund is going to catch it. i don\\'t want richard, my name\\n...\\n\\n_(laughter)_\\n\\nquakerlyster: (_a tempo_) but he that filches from me my good name...\\n\\nstephen: _(stringendo)_ he has hidden his own name, a fair name,\\nwilliam, in the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old\\nitaly set his face in a dark corner of his canvas. he has revealed it in\\nthe sonnets where there is will in overplus. like john o\\'gaunt his name\\nis dear to him, as dear as the coat and crest he toadied for, on a bend\\nsable a spear or steeled argent, honorificabilitudinitatibus, dearer\\nthan his glory of greatest shakescene in the country. what\\'s in a name?\\nthat is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the name that\\nwe are told is ours. a star, a daystar, a firedrake, rose at his birth.\\nit shone by day in the heavens alone, brighter than venus in the\\nnight, and by night it shone over delta in cassiopeia, the recumbent\\nconstellation which is the signature of his initial among the stars. his\\neyes watched it, lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the bear, as\\nhe walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight returning from\\nshottery and from her arms.\\n\\nboth

_autontimorumenos. bous stephanoumenos._ where\\'s your\\nconfiguration? stephen, stephen, cut the bread even. s. d: _sua donna.\\ngia: di lui. gelindo risolve di non amare_ s. d.\\n\\n--what is that, mr dedalus? the quaker librarian asked. was it a\\ncelestial phenomenon?\\n\\n--a star by night, stephen said. a pillar of the cloud by day.\\n\\nwhat more\\'s to speak?\\n\\nstephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.\\n\\n_stephanos,_ my crown. my sword. his boots are spoiling the shape of my\\nfeet. buy a pair. holes in my socks. handkerchief too.\\n\\n--you make good use of the name, john eglinton allowed. your own name is\\nstrange enough. i suppose it explains your fantastical humour.\\n\\nme, magee and mulligan.\\n\\nfabulous artificer. the hawklike man. you flew.

don\\'t you know, the fairytales. the\\nthird brother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best\\nprize.\\n\\nbest of best brothers. good, better, best.\\n\\nthe quaker librarian springhalted near.\\n\\n--i should like to know, he said, which brother you... i understand you\\nto suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers... but perhaps\\ni am anticipating?\\n\\nhe caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained.\\n\\nan attendant from the doorway called:\\n\\n--mr lyster! father dineen wants...\\n\\n--o, father dineen! directly.\\n\\nswiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.\\n\\njohn eglinton touched the foil.\\n\\n--come, he said. let us hear what you have to say of richard and edmund.\\nyou kept them for the last, didn\\'t you?\\n\\n--in asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle richie and\\nnuncle edmund, stephen answered, i feel i am asking too much perhaps. a\\nbrother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.\\n\\nlapwing.\\n\\nwhere is your brother? apothecaries\\' hall. my whetstone. him, then\\ncranly, mulligan: now these. speech, speech. but act. act speech. they\\nmock to try you. act. be acted on.\\n\\nlapwing.\\n\\ni am tired of my voice, the voice of esau. my kingdom for a drink.\\n\\non.\\n\\n--you will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he\\ntook the stuff of his plays. why did he take them rather than others?\\nrichard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed ann\\n(what\\'s in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow. richard\\nthe conqueror, third brother, came after william the conquered. the\\nother four acts of that play hang limply from that first. of all his\\nkings richard is the only king unshielded by shakespeare\\'s reverence,\\nthe angel of the world. why is the underplot of _king lear_ in which\\nedmund figures lifted out of sidney\\'s _arcadia_ and spatchcocked on to a\\nceltic legend older than history?\\n\\n--that was will\\'s way, john eglinton defended. we should not now combine\\na norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by george meredith. _que\\nvoulez-vous?_ moore would say. he puts bohemia on the seacoast and makes\\nulysses quote aristotle.\\n\\n--why? stephen answered himself. because the theme of the false or\\nthe usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to\\nshakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him. the note of\\nbanishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds\\nuninterruptedly from _the two gentlemen of verona_ onward till prospero\\nbreaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his\\nbook. it doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in\\nanother, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.\\nit repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married\\ndaughter susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. but it\\nwas the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will\\nand left in him a strong inclination to evil. the words are those of\\nmy lords bishops of maynooth. an original sin and, like original sin,\\ncommitted by another in whose sin he too has sinned. it is between the\\nlines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under\\nwhich her four bones are not to be laid. age has not withered it. beauty\\nand peace have not done it away. it is in infinite variety everywhere in\\nthe world he has created, in _much ado about nothing_, twice in _as you\\nlike it_, in _the tempest_, in _hamlet,_ in _measure for measure_--and\\nin all the other plays which i have not read.\\n\\nhe laughed to free his mind from his mind\\'s bondage.\\n\\njudge eglinton summed up.\\n\\n--the truth is midway, he affirmed. he is the ghost and the prince. he\\nis all in all.\\n\\n--he is, stephen said. the boy of act one is the mature man of act five.\\nall in all. in _cymbeline,_ in _othello_ he is bawd and cuckold. he acts\\nand is acted on. lover of an ideal or a perversion, like jose he\\nkills the real carmen. his unremitting intellect is the hornmad iago\\nceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.\\n\\n--cuckoo! cuckoo! cuck mulligan clucked lewdly. o word of fear!\\n\\ndark dome received, reverbed.\\n\\n--and what a character is iago! undaunted john eglinton exclaimed. when\\nall is said dumas _fils_ (or is it dumas _pere?)_ is right. after god\\nshakespeare has created most.\\n\\n--man delights him not nor woman neither, stephen said. he returns after\\na life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has\\nalways been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of\\nlife ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth. then dies. the\\nmotion is ended. gravediggers bury hamlet _(pere?)_ and hamlet _fils._\\na king and a prince at last in death, with incidental music. and, what\\nthough murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for,\\ndane or dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom\\nthey refuse to be divorced. if you like the epilogue look long on it:\\nprosperous prospero, the good man rewarded, lizzie, grandpa\\'s lump of\\nlove, and nuncle richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the\\nplace where the bad niggers go. strong curtain. he found in the world\\nwithout as actual what was in his world within as possible. maeterlinck\\nsays: _if socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated\\non his doorstep. if judas go forth tonight it is to judas his steps\\nwill tend._ every life is many days, day after day. we walk through\\nourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives,\\nwidows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves. the playwright\\nwho wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (he gave us light\\nfirst and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom\\nthe most roman of catholics call _dio boia_, hangman god, is doubtless\\nall in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and\\ncuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by hamlet, there\\nare no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife\\nunto himself.\\n\\n_--eureka!_ buck mulligan cried. _eureka!_\\n\\nsuddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride john eglinton\\'s\\ndesk.\\n\\n--may i? he said. the lord has spoken to malachi.\\n\\nhe began to scribble on a slip of paper.\\n\\ntake some slips from the counter going

you have\\nbrought us all this way to show us a french triangle. do you believe\\nyour own theory?\\n\\n--no, stephen said promptly.\\n\\n--are you going to write it? mr best asked. you ought to make it a\\ndialogue, don\\'t you know, like the platonic dialogues wilde wrote.\\n\\njohn eclecticon doubly smiled.\\n\\n--well, in that case, he said, i don\\'t see why you should expect payment\\nfor it since you don\\'t believe it yourself. dowden believes there is\\nsome mystery in _hamlet_ but will say no more. herr bleibtreu, the man\\npiper met in berlin, who is working up that rutland theory, believes\\nthat the secret is hidden in the stratford monument. he is going to\\nvisit the present duke, piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor\\nwrote the plays. it will come as a surprise to his grace. but he\\nbelieves his theory.\\n\\ni believe, o lord, help my unbelief. that is, help me to believe or help\\nme to unbelieve? who helps to believe? _egomen._ who to unbelieve?

scribbling, laughing: and then\\ngravely said, honeying malice:\\n\\n--i called upon the bard kinch at his summer residence in upper\\nmecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the _summa

of cardinal wolsey\\'s words:\\n_if i had served my god as i have served my king he would not have\\nabandoned me in my old days._ he walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking\\nleaves: and towards him

were they getting on well at\\nbelvedere? was that so? father conmee was very glad indeed to hear that.\\nand mr sheehy himself? still in london. the house was still sitting, to\\nbe sure it was.

sheehy.\\n\\nfather conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the\\njet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. and smiled yet again,\\nin going. he had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.\\n\\nfather conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on father\\nbernard vaughan\\'s droll eyes and cockney voice.\\n\\n--pilate! wy don\\'t you old back that owlin mob?\\n\\na zealous man, however. really he was. and really did great good in his\\nway. beyond a doubt. he loved ireland, he said, and he loved the irish.\\nof good family too would one think it?

mind you don\\'t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.\\n\\nthe boys sixeyed father conmee and laughed:\\n\\n--o, sir.\\n\\n--well, let me see if you can post a letter, father conmee said.\\n\\nmaster brunny lynam ran across the road and put father conmee\\'s letter\\nto father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. father\\nconmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along mountjoy square\\neast.\\n\\nmr denis j maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate\\nfrockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender\\ntrousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave\\ndeportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady\\nmaxwell at the corner of dignam\\'s court.\\n\\nwas that not mrs m\\'guinness?\\n\\nmrs m\\'guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to father conmee from the\\nfarther footpath along which she sailed. and father conmee smiled and\\nsaluted. how did she do?\\n\\na fine carriage she had. like mary, queen of scots, something. and to\\nthink that she was a pawnbroker! well, now! such a... what should he\\nsay?... such a queenly mien.\\n\\nfather conmee walked down great charles street and glanced at the shutup\\nfree church on his left. the reverend t. r. greene b.a. will (d.v.)\\nspeak. the incumbent they called him. he felt it incumbent on him to say\\na few words. but one should be charitable. invincible ignorance. they\\nacted according to their lights.\\n\\nfather conmee turned the corner and walked along the north circular\\nroad. it was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important\\nthoroughfare. surely, there ought to be.\\n\\na band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from richmond street. all\\nraised untidy caps. father conmee greeted them more than once benignly.\\nchristian brother boys.\\n\\nfather conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. saint\\njoseph\\'s church, portland row. for aged and virtuous females.\\nfather conmee raised his hat to the blessed sacrament. virtuous: but\\noccasionally they were also badtempered.\\n\\nnear aldborough house father conmee thought of that spendthrift\\nnobleman. and now it was an office or something.\\n\\nfather conmee began to walk along the north strand road and was saluted\\nby mr william gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. father\\nconmee saluted mr william gallagher and perceived the odours that came\\nfrom baconflitches and ample cools of butter. he passed grogan\\'s the\\ntobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful\\ncatastrophe in new york. in america those things were continually\\nhappening. unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. still, an\\nact of perfect contrition.\\n\\nfather conmee went by daniel bergin\\'s publichouse against the window of\\nwhich two unlabouring men lounged. they saluted him and were saluted.\\n\\nfather conmee passed h. j. o\\'neill\\'s funeral establishment where corny\\nkelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.\\na constable on his beat saluted father conmee and father conmee saluted\\nthe constable. in youkstetter\\'s, the porkbutcher\\'s, father conmee\\nobserved pig\\'s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in\\ntubes.\\n\\nmoored under the trees of charleville mall father conmee saw a\\nturfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty\\nstraw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above\\nhim. it was idyllic: and father conmee reflected on the providence of\\nthe creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it\\nout and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor\\npeople.\\n\\non newcomen bridge the very reverend john conmee s.j. of saint francis\\nxavier\\'s church, upper gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound\\ntram.\\n\\noff an inward bound tram stepped the reverend nicholas dudley c. c. of\\nsaint agatha\\'s church, north william street, on to newcomen bridge.\\n\\nat newcomen bridge father conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for\\nhe disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past mud island.\\n\\nfather conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with\\ncare in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence\\nand five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse.\\npassing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually\\nmade his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket. the\\nsolemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to father conmee excessive\\nfor a journey so short and cheap. father conmee liked cheerful decorum.\\n\\nit was a peaceful day. the gentleman with the glasses opposite father\\nconmee had finished explaining and looked down. his wife, father conmee\\nsupposed. a tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with\\nthe glasses. she raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently,\\ntiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily,\\nsweetly.\\n\\nfather conmee perceived her perfume in the car. he perceived also that\\nthe awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the\\nseat.\\n\\nfather conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the\\nmouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.\\n\\nat annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old\\nwoman rose suddenly from her place to alight. the conductor pulled the\\nbellstrap to stay the car for her. she passed out with her basket and\\na marketnet: and father conmee saw the conductor help her and net and\\nbasket down: and father conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed\\nthe end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had\\nalways to be told twice _bless you, my child,_ that they have been\\nabsolved, _pray for me._ but they had so many worries in life, so many\\ncares, poor creatures.\\n\\nfrom the hoardings mr eugene stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at\\nfather conmee.\\n\\nfather conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and\\nof his sermon on saint peter claver s.j. and the african mission and of\\nthe propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and\\nyellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last\\nhour came like a thief in the night. that book by the belgian jesuit,\\n_le nombre des elus,_ seemed to father conmee a reasonable plea. those\\nwere millions of human souls created by god in his own likeness to\\nwhom the faith had not (d.v.) been brought. but they were god\\'s souls,\\ncreated by god. it seemed to father conmee a pity that they should all\\nbe lost, a waste, if one might say.\\n\\nat the howth road stop father conmee alighted, was saluted by the\\nconductor and saluted in his turn.\\n\\nthe malahide road was quiet. it pleased father conmee, road and name.\\nthe joybells were ringing in gay malahide. lord talbot de malahide,\\nimmediate hereditary lord admiral of malahide and the seas adjoining.\\nthen came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.\\nthose were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times\\nin the barony.\\n\\nfather conmee, walking, thought of his little book _old times in the\\nbarony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of\\nmary rochfort, daughter of lord molesworth, first countess of belvedere.\\n\\na listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough ennel,\\nmary, first countess of belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening,\\nnot startled when an otter plunged. who could know the truth? not the\\njealous lord belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed\\nadultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris,_ with\\nher husband\\'s brother? she would half confess if she had not all sinned\\nas women did. only god knew and she and he, her husband\\'s brother.\\n\\nfather conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for\\nman\\'s race on earth, and of the ways of god which were not our ways.\\n\\ndon john conmee walked and moved in times of yore. he was humane and\\nhonoured there. he bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at\\nsmiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit\\nclusters. and the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble,\\nwere impalmed by don john conmee.\\n\\nit was a charming day.\\n\\nthe lychgate of a field showed father conmee breadths of cabbages,\\ncurtseying to him with ample underleaves. the sky showed him a flock of\\nsmall white clouds going slowly down the wind. _moutonner,_ the french\\nsaid. a just and homely word.\\n\\nfather conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds\\nover rathcoffey. his thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of\\nclongowes field. he walked there, reading in the evening, and heard\\nthe cries of the boys\\' lines at their play, young cries in the quiet\\nevening. he was their rector: his reign was mild.\\n\\nfather conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out. an\\nivory bookmark told him the page.\\n\\nnones. he should have read that before lunch. but lady maxwell had come.\\n\\nfather conmee read in secret _pater_ and _ave_ and crossed his breast.\\n_deus in adiutorium._\\n\\nhe walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he\\ncame to _res_ in _beati immaculati: principium verborum tuorum veritas:\\nin eternum omnia indicia iustitiae tuae._\\n\\na flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a\\nyoung woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. the young man raised\\nhis cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care\\ndetached from her light skirt a clinging twig.\\n\\nfather conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his\\nbreviary. _sin: principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis\\nformidavit cor meum._\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\ncorny kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye\\nat a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. he pulled himself erect,\\nwent to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass\\nfurnishings. chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came\\nto the doorway. there he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes\\nand leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.\\n\\nfather john conmee stepped into the dollymount tram on newcomen bridge.\\n\\ncorny kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat\\ndowntilted, chewing his blade of hay.\\n\\nconstable 57c, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.\\n\\n--that\\'s a fine day, mr kelleher.\\n\\n--ay, corny kelleher said.\\n\\n--it\\'s very close, the constable said.\\n\\ncorny kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth\\nwhile a generous white arm from a window in eccles street flung forth a\\ncoin.\\n\\n--what\\'s the best news? he asked.\\n\\n--i seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with\\nbated breath.\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\na onelegged sailor crutched himself round macconnell\\'s corner, skirting\\nrabaiotti\\'s icecream car, and jerked himself up eccles street. towards\\nlarry o\\'rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:\\n\\n--_for england_...\\n\\nhe swung himself violently forward past katey and boody dedalus, halted\\nand growled:\\n\\n--_home and beauty._\\n\\nj. j. o\\'molloy\\'s white careworn face was told that mr lambert was in the\\nwarehouse with a visitor.\\n\\na stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it\\ninto the cap held out to her. the sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly\\nat the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four\\nstrides.\\n\\nhe halted and growled angrily:\\n\\n--_for england_...\\n\\ntwo barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him,\\ngaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.\\n\\nhe swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head\\ntowards a window and bayed deeply:\\n\\n--_home and beauty._\\n\\nthe gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.\\nthe blind of the window was drawn aside. a card _unfurnished apartments_\\nslipped from the sash and fell. a plump bare generous arm shone, was\\nseen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps. a\\nwoman\\'s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings. it fell on the\\npath.\\n\\none of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the\\nminstrel\\'s cap, saying:\\n\\n--there, sir.\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\nkatey and boody dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.\\n\\n--did you put in the books? boody asked.\\n\\nmaggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds\\ntwice with her potstick and wiped her brow.\\n\\n--they wouldn\\'t give anything on them, she said.\\n\\nfather conmee walked through clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles\\ntickled by stubble.\\n\\n--where did you try? boody asked.\\n\\n--m\\'guinness\\'s.\\n\\nboody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.\\n\\n--bad cess to her big face! she cried.\\n\\nkatey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.\\n\\n--what\\'s in the pot? she asked.\\n\\n--shirts, maggy said.\\n\\nboody cried angrily:\\n\\n--crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?\\n\\nkatey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:\\n\\n--and what\\'s in this?\\n\\na heavy fume gushed in answer.\\n\\n--peasoup, maggy said.\\n\\n--where did you get it? katey asked.\\n\\n--sister mary patrick, maggy said.\\n\\nthe lacquey rang his bell.\\n\\n--barang!\\n\\nboody sat down at the table and said hungrily:\\n\\n--give us it here.\\n\\nmaggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. katey,\\nsitting opposite boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her\\nmouth random crumbs:\\n\\n--a good job we have that much. where\\'s dilly?\\n\\n--gone to meet father, maggy said.\\n\\nboody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:\\n\\n--our father who art not in heaven.\\n\\nmaggy, pouring yellow soup in katey\\'s bowl, exclaimed:\\n\\n--boody! for shame!\\n\\na skiff, a crumpled throwaway, elijah is coming, rode lightly down the\\nliffey, under loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed\\naround the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains,\\nbetween the customhouse old dock and

you?\\n\\n--no, ned.\\n\\n--he rode down through dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory\\nserves me. the mansion of the kildares was in thomas court.\\n\\n--that\\'s right, ned lambert said. that\\'s quite right, sir.\\n\\n--if you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to\\nallow me perhaps...\\n\\n--certainly, ned lambert said. bring the camera whenever you like. i\\'ll\\nget those bags cleared away from the windows. you can take it from here\\nor from here.\\n\\nin the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled\\nseedbags and points of vantage on the floor.\\n\\nfrom a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.\\n\\n--i\\'m deeply obliged, mr lambert, the clergyman said. i won\\'t trespass\\non your valuable

you.\\n\\n--pleasure is mine, sir, ned lambert answered.\\n\\nhe followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among\\nthe pillars. with j. j. o\\'molloy he came forth slowly into mary\\'s abbey\\nwhere draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal,\\no\\'connor, wexford.\\n\\nhe stood to read the card in his hand.\\n\\n--the reverend hugh c. love,

cried. i forgot to tell him that one about the earl of kildare\\nafter he set fire to cashel cathedral. you know that one? _i\\'m bloody\\nsorry i did it,_ says he, _but i declare to god i thought the archbishop\\nwas inside._ he mightn\\'t like it, though. what? god, i\\'ll tell him\\nanyhow. that was the great earl, the fitzgerald mor. hot members they\\nwere all of them, the geraldines.\\n\\nthe horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. he\\nslapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:\\n\\n--woa, sonny!\\n\\nhe turned to j. j. o\\'molloy and asked:\\n\\n--well, jack. what is it? what\\'s the trouble? wait awhile. hold hard.\\n\\nwith gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an\\ninstant, sneezed loudly.\\n\\n--chow! he said. blast you!\\n\\n--the dust from those sacks, j. j. o\\'molloy said politely.\\n\\n--no, ned lambert gasped, i caught a... cold night before... blast\\nyour soul... night before last... and there was a hell

rising column of disks on the right.\\n\\n--smart idea, nosey flynn said, snuffling. so a fellow coming in late\\ncan see what turn is on and what turns are over.\\n\\n--see? tom rochford said.\\n\\nhe slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop:\\nfour. turn now on.\\n\\n--i\\'ll see him now in the ormond, lenehan said, and sound him. one good\\nturn deserves another.\\n\\n--do, tom rochford said. tell him i\\'m boylan with impatience.\\n\\n--goodnight, m\\'coy said abruptly. when you two begin\\n\\nnosey flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at

said simply.\\n\\n--i know, m\\'coy said. the drain, you mean.\\n\\n--drain? lenehan said. it was down a manhole.\\n\\nthey passed dan lowry\\'s musichall where marie kendall, charming\\nsoubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.\\n\\ngoing down the path of sycamore street beside the empire musichall\\nlenehan showed m\\'coy how the whole thing was. one of those manholes like\\na bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half\\nchoked with sewer gas. down went tom rochford anyhow, booky\\'s vest and\\nall, with the rope round him. and be damned but he got the rope round\\nthe poor devil and the two were hauled up.\\n\\n--the act of a hero, he said.\\n\\nat the dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past\\nthem for jervis

the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal\\ncavalcade.\\n\\n--even money, lenehan said returning. i knocked against bantam lyons\\nin there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn\\'t an\\nearthly. through here.\\n\\nthey went up the steps and under merchants\\' arch. a darkbacked figure\\nscanned books on the hawker\\'s cart.\\n\\n--there he is, lenehan said.\\n\\n--wonder what he\\'s buying, m\\'coy said, glancing behind.\\n\\n--_leopoldo or the bloom is on the rye,_ lenehan said.\\n\\n--he\\'s dead nuts on sales, m\\'coy said. i was with him one day and he\\nbought a book from an old one in liffey street for two bob. there were\\nfine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and\\ncomets with long tails. astronomy it was about.\\n\\nlenehan laughed.\\n\\n--i\\'ll tell you a damn good one about comets\\' tails, he said. come over\\nin the sun.\\n\\nthey crossed to the metal bridge and went along wellington quay by the\\nriverwall.\\n\\nmaster patrick aloysius dignam came out of mangan\\'s, late fehrenbach\\'s,\\ncarrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.\\n\\n--there was a long spread out at glencree reformatory, lenehan said\\neagerly. the annual dinner, you know. boiled shirt affair. the lord\\nmayor was there, val dillon it was, and sir charles cameron and dan\\ndawson spoke and there was music. bartell d\\'arcy sang and benjamin\\ndollard...\\n\\n--i know, m\\'coy broke in. my missus sang there once.\\n\\n--did she? lenehan said.\\n\\na card _unfurnished apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number 7\\neccles street.\\n\\nhe checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.\\n\\n--but wait till i tell you, he said. delahunt of camden street had the\\ncatering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. bloom and the wife were\\nthere. lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacao to\\nwhich we did ample justice. fast and furious it was. after liquids came\\nsolids. cold joints galore and mince pies...\\n\\n--i know, m\\'coy said. the year the missus was there...\\n\\nlenehan linked his arm warmly.\\n\\n--but wait till i tell you, he said. we had a midnight lunch too after\\nall the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o\\'clock the\\nmorning after the night before. coming home it was a gorgeous winter\\'s\\nnight on the featherbed mountain. bloom and chris callinan were on one\\nside of the car and i was with the wife on the other. we started singing\\nglees and duets: _lo, the early beam of morning_. she was well primed\\nwith a good load of delahunt\\'s port under her bellyband. every jolt the\\nbloody car gave i had her bumping up against me. hell\\'s delights! she\\nhas a fine pair, god bless her. like that.\\n\\nhe held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:\\n\\n--i was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time.\\nknow what i mean?\\n\\nhis hands moulded ample curves of air. he shut his eyes tight in\\ndelight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.\\n\\n--the lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. she\\'s a gamey\\nmare and no mistake. bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets\\nin the heavens to chris callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and\\nhercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. but, by god, i was\\nlost, so to speak, in the milky way. he knows them all, faith. at last\\nshe spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. _and what star is that,\\npoldy?_ says she. by god, she had bloom cornered. _that one, is it?_\\nsays chris callinan, _sure that\\'s only what you might call a pinprick._\\nby god, he wasn\\'t far wide of the mark.\\n\\nlenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.\\n\\n--i\\'m weak, he gasped.\\n\\nm\\'coy\\'s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave. lenehan\\nwalked on again. he lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead\\nrapidly. he glanced sideways in the sunlight at m\\'coy.\\n\\n--he\\'s a cultured allroundman, bloom is, he said seriously. he\\'s not one\\nof your common or garden... you know... there\\'s a touch of the artist\\nabout old bloom.\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\nmr bloom turned over idly pages of _the awful disclosures of maria\\nmonk,_ then of aristotle\\'s _masterpiece._ crooked botched

bundle of the other books, hugged them against his\\nunbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.\\n\\non o\\'connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay\\napparel of mr denis j maginni, professor of dancing &c.\\n\\nmr bloom, alone, looked at the titles. _fair tyrants_ by james\\nlovebirch. know the kind that is. had it? yes.\\n\\nhe opened it.

played\\nround her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly._\\n\\nmr bloom read again: _the beautiful woman._\\n\\nwarmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. flesh yielded amply\\namid

bookshop, bulging out the dingy\\ncurtains. the shopman\\'s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven\\nreddened face, coughing. he raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the\\nfloor. he put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it,\\nand bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.\\n\\nmr bloom beheld it.\\n\\nmastering his troubled breath, he said:\\n\\n--i\\'ll take

answered, stopping.\\n\\nthey clasped hands loudly outside reddy and daughter\\'s. father cowley\\nbrushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.\\n\\n--what\\'s the best news? mr dedalus said.\\n\\n--why then not much, father cowley said. i\\'m barricaded up, simon, with\\ntwo men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.\\n\\n--jolly, mr dedalus said. who is it?\\n\\n--o, father cowley said. a certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.\\n\\n--with a broken back, is it? mr dedalus asked.\\n\\n--the same, simon, father cowley answered. reuben of that ilk. i\\'m just\\nwaiting for ben dollard. he\\'s going to say a word to long john to get\\nhim to take those two men off. all i want is a little time.\\n\\nhe looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in\\nhis neck.\\n\\n--i know, mr dedalus said, nodding. poor old bockedy ben! he\\'s always\\ndoing a good turn for someone. hold hard!\\n\\nhe put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.\\n\\n--there he is, by god, he said, arse and pockets.\\n\\nben dollard\\'s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops\\ncrossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. he came towards\\nthem at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.\\n\\nas he came near mr dedalus greeted:\\n\\n--hold that fellow with the bad trousers.\\n\\n--hold him now, ben dollard said.\\n\\nmr dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of ben\\ndollard\\'s figure. then, turning to father cowley with a nod, he muttered\\nsneeringly:\\n\\n--that\\'s a pretty garment, isn\\'t it, for a summer\\'s day?\\n\\n--why, god eternally curse your soul, ben dollard growled furiously, i\\nthrew out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.\\n\\nhe stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes\\nfrom points of which mr dedalus flicked fluff, saying:\\n\\n--they were made for a man in his health, ben, anyhow.\\n\\n--bad luck to the jewman that made them, ben dollard said. thanks be to\\ngod he\\'s not paid yet.\\n\\n--and how is that _basso profondo_, benjamin? father cowley asked.\\n\\ncashel boyle o\\'connor fitzmaurice tisdall farrell, murmuring,\\nglassyeyed, strode past the kildare street club.\\n\\nben dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter\\'s mouth, gave forth a\\ndeep note.\\n\\n--aw! he said.\\n\\n--that\\'s the style, mr dedalus said, nodding to its drone.\\n\\n--what about that? ben dollard said. not too dusty? what?\\n\\nhe turned to both.\\n\\n--that\\'ll do, father cowley said, nodding also.\\n\\nthe reverend hugh c. love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint\\nmary\\'s abbey past james and charles kennedy\\'s, rectifiers, attended by\\ngeraldines tall and personable, towards the tholsel beyond the ford of\\nhurdles.\\n\\nben dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward,\\nhis joyful fingers in the air.\\n\\n--come along with me to the subsheriff\\'s office, he said. i want to\\nshow you the new beauty rock has for a bailiff. he\\'s a cross between\\nlobengula and lynchehaun. he\\'s well worth seeing, mind you. come along.\\ni saw john henry menton casually in the bodega just now and it will cost\\nme a fall if i don\\'t... wait awhile... we\\'re on the right lay, bob,\\nbelieve you me.\\n\\n--for a few days tell him, father cowley said anxiously.\\n\\nben dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button\\nof his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the\\nheavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.\\n\\n--what few days? he boomed. hasn\\'t your landlord distrained for rent?\\n\\n--he has, father cowley said.\\n\\n--then our friend\\'s writ is not worth the paper it\\'s printed on, ben\\ndollard said. the landlord has the prior claim. i gave him all the\\nparticulars. 29 windsor avenue. love is the name?\\n\\n--that\\'s right, father cowley said. the reverend mr love. he\\'s a\\nminister in the country somewhere. but are you sure of that?\\n\\n--you can tell barabbas from me, ben dollard said, that he can put that\\nwrit where jacko put the nuts.\\n\\nhe led father cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.\\n\\n--filberts i believe they were, mr dedalus said, as he dropped his\\nglasses on his coatfront, following them.\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\n--the

crossblind of the ormond hotel.\\n\\n--yes, martin cunningham said, fingering his beard. i wrote to father\\nconmee and laid the whole case before him.\\n\\n--you could try our friend, mr power suggested backward.\\n\\n--boyd? martin cunningham said shortly. touch me not.\\n\\njohn wyse nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them\\nquickly down cork hill.\\n\\non the steps of the city hall councillor nannetti, descending, hailed\\nalderman cowley and councillor abraham lyon ascending.\\n\\nthe castle car wheeled empty into upper exchange street.\\n\\n--look here, martin, john wyse nolan said, overtaking them at the _mail_\\noffice. i see bloom put his name down for five shillings.\\n\\n--quite right, martin cunningham said, taking the list. and put down the\\nfive shillings too.\\n\\n--without a second word either, mr power said.\\n\\n--strange but true, martin cunningham added.\\n\\njohn wyse nolan opened wide eyes.\\n\\n--i\\'ll say there is much kindness in

giving him some trouble, john\\nwyse nolan told mr power.\\n\\nthey followed round the corner towards james kavanagh\\'s winerooms. the\\nempty castle car fronted them at rest in essex gate. martin cunningham,\\nspeaking always, showed often the list at which jimmy henry did not\\nglance.\\n\\n--and long john fanning is here too, john wyse nolan said, as large as\\nlife.\\n\\nthe tall form of long john fanning filled the doorway where he stood.\\n\\n--good day, mr subsheriff, martin cunningham said, as all halted and\\ngreeted.\\n\\nlong john fanning made no way for them. he removed his large henry clay\\ndecisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all\\ntheir faces.\\n\\n--are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he\\nsaid with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.\\n\\nhell open to christians they were having, jimmy henry said pettishly,\\nabout their damned irish language. where was the marshal, he wanted\\nto know, to keep order in the council chamber. and old barlow the\\nmacebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order,\\nno quorum even, and hutchinson, the lord mayor, in llandudno and little\\nlorcan sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him. damned irish language,\\nlanguage of our forefathers.\\n\\nlong john fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.\\n\\nmartin cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the\\nassistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while john wyse nolan held his\\npeace.\\n\\n--what dignam was that? long john fanning asked.\\n\\njimmy henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.\\n\\n--o, my corns! he said plaintively. come upstairs for goodness\\' sake\\ntill i sit down somewhere. uff! ooo! mind!\\n\\ntestily he made room for himself beside long john fanning\\'s flank and\\npassed in and up the stairs.\\n\\n--come on up, martin cunningham said to the subsheriff. i don\\'t think\\nyou knew him or perhaps you did, though.\\n\\nwith john wyse nolan mr power followed them in.\\n\\n--decent little soul he was, mr power said to the stalwart back of long\\njohn fanning ascending towards long john fanning in the mirror.\\n\\n--rather lowsized. dignam of menton\\'s office that was, martin cunningham\\nsaid.\\n\\nlong john fanning could not remember him.\\n\\nclatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.\\n\\n--what\\'s that? martin cunningham said.\\n\\nall turned where they stood. john wyse nolan came down again. from the\\ncool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass parliament street,\\nharness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. gaily they went past\\nbefore his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. in saddles of the leaders,\\nleaping leaders, rode outriders.\\n\\n--what was it? martin cunningham asked, as they went on up the\\nstaircase.\\n\\n--the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of ireland, john wyse\\nnolan answered from the stairfoot.\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\nas they trod across the thick carpet buck mulligan whispered behind his\\npanama to haines:\\n\\n--parnell\\'s brother. there in the corner.\\n\\nthey chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose\\nbeard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.\\n\\n--is that he? haines asked, twisting round in his seat.\\n\\n--yes, mulligan said. that\\'s john howard, his brother, our city marshal.\\n\\njohn howard parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw\\nwent up again to his forehead whereat it rested. an instant after, under\\nits screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell\\nonce more upon a working corner.\\n\\n--i\\'ll take a _melange,_ haines said to the waitress.\\n\\n--two _melanges,_ buck mulligan said. and bring us some scones and\\nbutter and some cakes as well.\\n\\nwhen she had gone he said, laughing:\\n\\n--we call it d.b.c. because they have damn bad cakes. o, but you missed\\ndedalus on _hamlet._\\n\\nhaines opened his newbought book.\\n\\n--i\\'m sorry, he said. shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all\\nminds that have lost their balance.\\n\\nthe onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 nelson street:\\n\\n--_england expects_...\\n\\nbuck mulligan\\'s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.\\n\\n--you should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance.\\nwandering aengus i call him.\\n\\n--i am sure he has an _idee fixe,_ haines said, pinching his chin\\nthoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. now i am speculating what it\\nwould be likely to be. such persons always have.\\n\\nbuck mulligan bent across the table gravely.\\n\\n--they drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. he will never\\ncapture the attic note. the note of swinburne, of all poets, the white\\ndeath and the ruddy birth. that is his tragedy. he can never be a poet.\\nthe joy of creation...\\n\\n--eternal punishment, haines said, nodding curtly. i see. i tackled him\\nthis morning on belief. there was something on his mind, i saw.\\nit\\'s rather interesting because professor pokorny of vienna makes an\\ninteresting point out of that.\\n\\nbuck mulligan\\'s watchful eyes saw the waitress come. he helped her to\\nunload her tray.\\n\\n--he can find no trace of hell in ancient irish myth, haines said, amid\\nthe cheerful cups. the moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny,\\nof retribution. rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. does\\nhe write anything for your movement?\\n\\nhe sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.\\nbuck mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its\\nsmoking pith. he bit off a soft piece hungrily.\\n\\n--ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. he is going to write\\nsomething in ten years.\\n\\n--seems a long way off, haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.\\nstill, i shouldn\\'t wonder if he did after all.\\n\\nhe tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.\\n\\n--this is real irish cream i take it, he said with forbearance. i don\\'t\\nwant to be imposed on.\\n\\nelijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks

with mrs stoer and mrs quigley and mrs\\nmacdowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping\\nsups of the superior tawny sherry uncle barney brought from tunney\\'s.\\nand they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole\\nblooming time and sighing.\\n\\nafter wicklow lane the window of madame doyle, courtdress milliner,\\nstopped him. he stood looking in at the

thing is all over. he\\nturned to the right and on his right master dignam turned, his cap awry,\\nhis collar sticking up. buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the\\nimage of marie kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. one\\nof them mots that do be in the packets of fags stoer smokes that his old\\nfellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.\\n\\nmaster dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. the best pucker going\\nfor strength was fitzsimons. one puck in the wind from that fellow would\\nknock you into the middle of next week, man. but the best pucker for\\nscience was jem corbet before fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of\\nhim, dodging and all.\\n\\nin grafton street master dignam saw a red flower in a toff\\'s mouth and\\na swell pair of

tomorrow\\neither, stay away till monday. he met other schoolboys. do they notice\\ni\\'m in mourning? uncle barney said he\\'d get it into the paper tonight.\\nthen they\\'ll all see it in the paper

screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were\\nbringing it downstairs.\\n\\npa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle barney telling\\nthe men how to get it round

vainly from afar between queen\\'s and whitworth bridges lord dudley\\'s\\nviceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by mr dudley white, b.\\nl., m. a., who stood on arran quay outside mrs m. e.

where the foreleg of king\\nbilly\\'s horse pawed the air mrs breen plucked her hastening husband\\nback from under the hoofs of the outriders. she shouted in his ear the\\ntidings. understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast\\nand saluted the second carriage. the honourable gerald ward a.d.c.,\\nagreeably surprised, made haste to reply. at ponsonby\\'s corner a jaded\\nwhite flagon h.

in\\nlife they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. a pleasant land\\nit is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the\\ngurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the\\ngrilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse\\nfish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to\\nbe enumerated. in the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty\\ntrees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty\\nsycamore, the lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic\\neucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which\\nthat region is thoroughly well supplied. lovely maidens sit in close\\nproximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs\\nwhile they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden\\ningots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings,\\ncreels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. and heroes\\nvoyage from afar to woo them, from eblana to slievemargy, the peerless\\nprinces of unfettered munster and of connacht the just and of smooth\\nsleek leinster and of cruahan\\'s land and of armagh the splendid and of\\nthe noble district of boyle, princes, the sons of kings.\\n\\nand there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen\\nby mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for\\nthat purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits\\nof that land for o\\'connell fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain\\ndescended from chieftains. thither the extremely large wains bring\\nfoison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach,\\npineapple chunks, rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs,\\ndrills of swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale,\\nyork and savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of\\nmushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red\\ngreen yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and\\nchips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious,\\nand strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.\\n\\ni dare him, says he, and i doubledare him. come out here, geraghty, you\\nnotorious bloody hill and dale robber!\\n\\nand by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed\\newes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers\\nand roaring mares and polled calves and longwoods and storesheep and\\ncuffe\\'s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the\\nvarious different varieties of highly distinguished swine and angus\\nheifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime\\npremiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling,\\ncackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting,\\nchamping, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from\\npasturelands of lusk and rush and carrickmines and from the streamy\\nvales of thomond, from the m\\'gillicuddy\\'s reeks the inaccessible and\\nlordly shannon the

and\\ntargets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds,\\nvarious in size, the agate with this dun.\\n\\nso we turned into barney kiernan\\'s and there, sure enough, was

i, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his\\nload of papers, working for the cause.\\n\\nthe bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. be\\na corporal work of mercy

barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed\\nhero. from shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his\\nrocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his\\nbody wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in\\nhue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_ulex europeus_).\\nthe widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue\\nprojected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous\\nobscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. the eyes\\nin which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the\\ndimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. a powerful current of warm breath\\nissued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth\\nwhile in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his\\nformidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of\\nthe lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and\\ntremble.\\n\\nhe wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching\\nto the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by\\na girdle of plaited straw and rushes. beneath this he wore trews of\\ndeerskin, roughly stitched with gut. his nether extremities were encased\\nin high balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod\\nwith brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same\\nbeast. from his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every\\nmovement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude\\nyet

straightway brought him a crystal cup\\nfull of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers bungiveagh and\\nbungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of\\ndeathless

him that\\nthirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.\\n\\nbut he, the young chief of the o\\'bergan\\'s, could ill brook to be outdone\\nin generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of\\ncostliest bronze. thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen\\nthe image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of brunswick,\\nvictoria her name, her most excellent majesty, by grace of god of the\\nunited kingdom of great britain and ireland and of the british dominions\\nbeyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, empress of india, even\\nshe, who

was what you might call flabbergasted.\\n\\nin the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by\\ntantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing\\nluminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of\\nthe etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge\\nof jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. communication was\\neffected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery\\nand scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus.\\nquestioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he\\nstated that he was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still\\nsubmitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the\\nlower astral levels. in reply to a question as to his first sensations\\nin the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a\\nglass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities\\nof atmic development opened up to them. interrogated as to whether life\\nthere resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard\\nfrom more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were\\nequipped with every modern home comfort such as talafana, alavatar,\\nhatakalda, wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in\\nwaves of volupcy of the very purest nature. having requested a quart of\\nbuttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. asked if he\\nhad any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the\\nwrong side of maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported\\nin devanic circles that mars and jupiter were out for mischief on the\\neastern angle where the ram has power. it was then queried whether there\\nwere any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was:\\n_we greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. mind c. k.\\ndoesn\\'t pile it on._ it was ascertained that the reference was to mr\\ncornelius kelleher, manager of messrs h. j. o\\'neill\\'s popular\\nfuneral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been\\nresponsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements. before\\ndeparting he requested that it should be told to his dear son patsy that\\nthe other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the\\ncommode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to cullen\\'s\\nto be soled only as the heels were still good. he stated that this had\\ngreatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly\\nrequested that his desire should be made known.\\n\\nassurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was\\nintimated that this had given satisfaction.\\n\\nhe is gone from mortal haunts: o\\'dignam, sun of our morning. fleet was\\nhis foot on the bracken: patrick of the beamy brow. wail, banba, with\\nyour wind: and wail, o ocean, with your whirlwind.\\n\\n--there he is again, says the citizen, staring out.\\n\\n--who? says i.\\n\\n--bloom, says he. he\\'s on point duty up and down there for the last ten\\nminutes.\\n\\nand, begob, i saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.\\n\\nlittle alf was knocked bawways. faith, he was.\\n\\n--good christ! says he. i could have sworn it was him.\\n\\nand says bob doran, with the hat on the back of his

poor little willy\\ndignam?\\n\\n--ah, well, says alf, trying to pass it off. he\\'s over all his troubles.\\n\\nbut bob doran shouts out of him.\\n\\n--he\\'s a bloody ruffian, i say, to take away poor little willy dignam.\\n\\nterry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn\\'t\\nwant that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. and bob doran\\nstarts doing the weeps about paddy dignam, true as you\\'re there.\\n\\n--the finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.\\n\\nthe tear is bloody near your eye. talking through his bloody hat. fitter\\nfor him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, mooney, the\\nbumbailiff\\'s daughter, mother kept a kip in hardwicke street, that\\nused to be stravaging about the landings bantam lyons told me that was\\nstopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing\\nher person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.\\n\\n--the noblest, the truest, says he. and he\\'s gone, poor little willy,\\npoor little paddy dignam.\\n\\nand mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that\\nbeam of heaven.\\n\\nold garryowen started growling again at bloom that was skeezing round\\nthe door.\\n\\n--come in, come on, he won\\'t eat you, says the citizen.\\n\\nso bloom slopes in with his cod\\'s eye on the dog and he asks terry was\\nmartin cunningham there.\\n\\n--o, christ m\\'keown, says joe, reading one of the letters. listen to\\nthis, will you?\\n\\nand he starts reading out one.\\n\\n_7 hunter street, liverpool. to the high

here, says he, take them\\nto hell out of my sight, alf. hello, bloom, says he, what will you have?\\n\\nso they started arguing about the point, bloom saying he wouldn\\'t and he\\ncouldn\\'t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well\\nhe\\'d just take a cigar. gob, he\\'s a prudent member and no mistake.\\n\\n--give us one of your prime stinkers, terry, says joe.\\n\\nand alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a\\nblack border round it.\\n\\n--they\\'re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang\\ntheir own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.\\n\\nand he was telling us there\\'s two fellows waiting below to pull his\\nheels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they\\nchop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.\\n\\nin the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. their\\ndeadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to erebus whatsoever\\nwight hath done a deed of blood for i will on nowise suffer it even so\\nsaith the lord.\\n\\nso they started talking about capital punishment and of course bloom\\ncomes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the\\nbusiness and the old dog smelling him all the time i\\'m told those jewies\\ndoes have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about i don\\'t\\nknow what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.\\n\\n--there\\'s one thing it hasn\\'t a deterrent effect on, says alf.\\n\\n--what\\'s that? says joe.\\n\\n--the poor bugger\\'s tool that\\'s being hanged, says alf.\\n\\n--that so? says joe.\\n\\n--god\\'s truth, says alf. i heard that from the head warder that was in\\n\\nkilmainham when they hanged joe brady, the invincible. he told me when\\nthey cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like\\na poker.\\n\\n--ruling passion strong in death, says joe, as someone said.\\n\\n--that can be explained by science, says bloom. it\\'s only a natural\\nphenomenon, don\\'t you see, because on account of the...\\n\\nand then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and\\nthis phenomenon and the other phenomenon.\\n\\nthe distinguished scientist herr professor luitpold blumenduft tendered\\nmedical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the\\ncervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,\\naccording to the best approved tradition of medical science, be\\ncalculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent\\nganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus,\\nthereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly\\ndilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood\\nto that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ\\nresulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty\\na morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo\\nmortis per diminutionem capitis._\\n\\nso of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and\\nhe starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and\\nthe men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and joe with\\nhim about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for\\nthe cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new ireland and new this, that\\nand the other. talking about new ireland he ought to go and get a new\\ndog so he ought. mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round\\nthe place and scratching his scabs. and round he goes to bob doran that\\nwas standing alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. so of\\ncourse bob doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:\\n\\n--give us the paw! give the paw, doggy! good old doggy! give the paw\\nhere! give us the paw!\\n\\narrah, bloody end to the paw he\\'d paw and alf trying to keep him from\\ntumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking\\nall kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and\\nintelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. then he starts scraping a few\\nbits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a jacobs\\' tin he told terry to\\nbring. gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging\\nout of him a yard long for more. near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody\\nmongrel.\\n\\nand the citizen and bloom having an argument about the point, the\\nbrothers sheares and wolfe tone beyond on arbour hill and robert emmet\\nand die for your country, the tommy moore touch about sara curran and\\nshe\\'s far from the land. and bloom, of course, with his knockmedown\\ncigar putting on swank with his lardy face. phenomenon! the fat heap he\\nmarried is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.\\ntime they were stopping up in the _city arms_ pisser burke told me there\\nwas an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and bloom\\ntrying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bezique\\nto come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a\\nfriday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the\\nlout out for a walk. and one time he led him the rounds of dublin and,\\nby the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as\\ndrunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of\\nalcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn\\'t near roast him, it\\'s\\na queer story, the old one, bloom\\'s wife and mrs o\\'dowd that kept the\\nhotel. jesus, i had to laugh at pisser burke taking them off chewing\\nthe fat. and bloom with his _but don\\'t you see?_ and _but on the other\\nhand_. and sure, more be token, the lout i\\'m told was in power\\'s after,\\nthe blender\\'s, round in cope street going home footless in a cab five\\ntimes in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the\\nbloody establishment. phenomenon!\\n\\n--the memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and\\nglaring at bloom.\\n\\n--ay, ay, says joe.\\n\\n--you don\\'t grasp my point, says bloom. what i mean is...\\n\\n--_sinn fein!_ says the citizen. _sinn fein amhain!_ the friends we love\\nare by our side and the foes we hate before us.\\n\\nthe last farewell was affecting in the extreme. from the belfries far\\nand near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the\\ngloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums\\npunctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. the deafening\\nclaps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up\\nthe ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its\\nsupernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. a torrential rain\\npoured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the\\nbared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the\\nlowest computation five hundred thousand persons. a posse of dublin\\nmetropolitan police superintended by the chief commissioner in person\\nmaintained order in the vast throng for whom the york street brass and\\nreed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on\\ntheir blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from\\nthe cradle by speranza\\'s plaintive muse. special quick excursion trains\\nand upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our\\ncountry cousins of whom there were large contingents. considerable\\namusement was caused by the favourite dublin streetsingers l-n-h-n and\\nm-ll-g-n who sang _the night before larry was stretched_ in their usual\\nmirth-provoking fashion. our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade\\nwith their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody\\nwho has a corner in his heart for real irish fun without vulgarity\\nwill grudge them their hardearned pennies. the children of the male and\\nfemale foundling hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene\\nwere delighted with this unexpected addition to the day\\'s entertainment\\nand a word of praise is due to the little sisters of the poor for their\\nexcellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children\\na genuinely instructive treat. the viceregal houseparty which included\\nmany wellknown ladies was chaperoned by their excellencies to the most\\nfavourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign\\ndelegation known as the friends of the emerald isle was accommodated\\non a tribune directly opposite. the delegation, present in full force,\\nconsisted of commendatore bacibaci beninobenone (the semiparalysed\\n_doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a\\npowerful steam crane), monsieur pierrepaul petitepatant, the grandjoker\\nvladinmire pokethankertscheff, the archjoker leopold rudolph von\\nschwanzenbad-hodenthaler, countess marha viraga

the\\ndelegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest\\npossible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which\\nthey had been called upon to witness. an animated altercation (in which\\nall took part) ensued among the f. o. t. e. i. as to whether the eighth\\nor the ninth of march was the correct date of the birth of ireland\\'s\\npatron saint. in the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars,\\nboomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas,\\ncatapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to\\nand blows were freely exchanged. the baby policeman, constable\\nmacfadden, summoned by special courier from booterstown, quickly\\nrestored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth\\nof the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending\\nparties. the readywitted ninefooter\\'s suggestion at once appealed to all\\nand was unanimously accepted. constable macfadden was heartily\\ncongratulated by all the f.o.t.e.i., several of whom were bleeding\\nprofusely. commendatore beninobenone having been extricated from\\nunderneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal\\nadviser avvocato pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his\\nthirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the\\npockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their\\nsenses. the objects (which included several hundred ladies\\' and\\ngentlemen\\'s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their\\nrightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.\\n\\nquietly, unassumingly rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless\\nmorning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _gladiolus\\ncruentus_. he announced his presence by that gentle rumboldian cough\\nwhich so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate--short,\\npainstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man. the arrival of the\\nworldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the\\nhuge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in\\ntheir excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates\\ncheered vociferously in a medley of cries, _hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio,\\nchinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, allah_, amid which the ringing\\n_evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song (a high double f recalling\\nthose piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch catalani beglamoured\\nour greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. it was exactly\\nseventeen o\\'clock. the signal for prayer was then promptly given by\\nmegaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore\\'s\\npatriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family\\nsince the revolution of rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser\\nin attendance, dr pippi. the learned prelate who administered the last\\ncomforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death\\npenalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his\\ncassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace\\nfervent prayers of supplication. hand by the block stood the grim figure\\nof the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot\\nwith two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered\\nfuriously. as he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his\\nhorrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated\\nin rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the\\nadmirers of his fell but necessary office. on a handsome mahogany table\\nnear him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various\\nfinely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the\\nworldfamous firm of cutlers, messrs john round and sons, sheffield),\\na terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon,\\nblind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two\\ncommodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the\\nmost precious victim. the housesteward of the amalgamated cats\\' and\\ndogs\\' home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished\\nto that beneficent institution. quite an excellent repast consisting of\\nrashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious\\nhot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided\\nby the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the\\ntragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced\\nthe keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he,\\nwith an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion\\nand expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal\\nshould be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and\\nindigent roomkeepers\\' association as a token of his regard and esteem.\\nthe _nec_ and _non plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing\\nbride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders\\nand flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be\\nlaunched into eternity for her sake. the hero folded her willowy form in\\na loving embrace murmuring fondly _sheila, my own_. encouraged by\\nthis use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various\\nsuitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb\\npermitted her ardour to reach. she swore to him as they mingled the salt\\nstreams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she\\nwould never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his\\nlips as if he were but going to a hurling match in clonturk park. she\\nbrought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood\\ntogether on the banks of anna liffey when they had indulged in the\\ninnocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present,\\nthey both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable\\npastor, joining in the general merriment. that monster audience simply\\nrocked with delight. but anon they were overcome with grief and clasped\\ntheir hands for the last time. a fresh torrent of tears burst from their\\nlachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost\\ncore, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the\\naged prebendary himself. big strong men, officers of the peace and\\ngenial giants of the royal irish constabulary, were making frank use of\\ntheir handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye\\nin that record assemblage. a most romantic incident occurred when a\\nhandsome young oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair\\nsex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook\\nand genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady,\\nrequesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. every lady\\nin the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion\\nin the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous\\nact which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young\\noxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names\\nin albion\\'s history) placed on the finger of his blushing _fiancee_ an\\nexpensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a\\nfourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. nay, even the\\nster provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel tomkin-maxwell ffrenchmullan\\ntomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a\\nconsiderable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching,\\ncould not now restrain his natural emotion. with his mailed gauntlet\\nhe brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged\\nburghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage,_ to murmur to\\nhimself in a faltering undertone:\\n\\n--god blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart. blimey it\\nmakes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when i sees her cause\\ni thinks of my old mashtub what\\'s waiting for me down limehouse way.\\n\\nso then the citizen begins talking about the irish language and the\\ncorporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can\\'t speak\\ntheir own language and joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a\\nquid and bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that\\nhe cadged off of joe and talking about the gaelic league and the\\nantitreating league and drink, the curse of ireland. antitreating is\\nabout the size of it. gob, he\\'d let you pour all manner of drink down\\nhis throat till the lord would call him before you\\'d ever see the froth\\nof his pint. and one night i went in with a fellow into one of their\\nmusical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of\\nhay she could my maureen lay and there was a fellow with a ballyhooly\\nblue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in irish and a lot of colleen\\nbawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals\\nand oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh\\nentertainment, don\\'t be talking. ireland sober is ireland free. and\\nthen an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers\\nshuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. and one or two\\nsky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the\\nfemales, hitting below the belt.\\n\\nso howandever, as i was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty\\nstarts mousing around by joe and me. i\\'d train him by kindness, so i\\nwould, if he was my dog. give him a rousing fine kick now and again\\nwhere it wouldn\\'t blind him.\\n\\n--afraid he\\'ll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.\\n\\n--no, says i. but he might take my leg for a lamppost.\\n\\nso he calls the old dog over.\\n\\n--what\\'s on you, garry? says he.\\n\\nthen he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in irish and the\\nold towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.\\nsuch growling you never heard as they let off between them. someone that\\nhas nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono publico_ to\\nthe papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. growling\\nand grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the\\nhydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.\\n\\nall those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the\\nlower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not\\nmissing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the\\nfamous old irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_ of\\ngarryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and\\nacquaintances owen garry. the exhibition, which is the result of years\\nof training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system,\\ncomprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse. our\\ngreatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!)\\nhas left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare\\nthe verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_ resemblance (the\\nitalics are ours) to the ranns of ancient celtic bards. we are not\\nspeaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who\\nconceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the little\\nsweet branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as\\na contributor d. o. c. points out in an interesting communication\\npublished by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal\\nnote which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous raftery and\\nof donal macconsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present\\nvery much in the public eye. we subjoin a specimen which has been\\nrendered into english by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we\\nare not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will\\nfind the topical allusion rather more than an indication. the metrical\\nsystem of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative\\nand isosyllabic rules of the welsh englyn, is infinitely more\\ncomplicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has\\nbeen well caught. perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly\\nincreased if owen\\'s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in\\na tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.\\n\\n     _the curse of my curses\\n     seven days every day\\n     and seven dry thursdays\\n     on you, barney kiernan,\\n     has no sup of water\\n     to cool my courage,\\n     and my guts red roaring\\n     after lowry\\'s lights._\\n\\nso he told terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could\\nhear him lapping it up a mile off. and joe asked him would he have\\nanother.\\n\\n--i will, says he, _a chara_, to show there\\'s no ill feeling.\\n\\ngob, he\\'s not as green as he\\'s cabbagelooking. arsing around from one\\npub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old giltrap\\'s dog\\nand getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. entertainment for\\nman and beast. and says joe:\\n\\n--could you make a hole in another pint?\\n\\n--could a swim duck? says i.\\n\\n--same again, terry, says joe. are you sure you won\\'t have anything in\\nthe way of liquid refreshment? says he.\\n\\n--thank you, no, says bloom. as a matter of fact i just wanted to meet\\nmartin cunningham, don\\'t you see, about this insurance of poor dignam\\'s.\\nmartin asked me to go to the house. you see, he, dignam, i mean, didn\\'t\\nserve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and\\nnominally under the act the mortgagee can\\'t recover on the policy.\\n\\n--holy wars, says joe, laughing, that\\'s a good one if old shylock is\\nlanded. so the wife comes out top dog, what?\\n\\n--well, that\\'s a point, says bloom, for the wife\\'s admirers.\\n\\n--whose admirers? says joe.\\n\\n--the wife\\'s advisers, i mean, says bloom.\\n\\nthen he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act\\nlike the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit\\nof the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that\\ndignam owed bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow\\ncontested the mortgagee\\'s right till he near had the head of me addled\\nwith his mortgagor under the act. he was bloody safe he wasn\\'t run in\\nhimself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a\\nfriend in court. selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal\\nhungarian privileged lottery. true as you\\'re there. o, commend me to an\\nisraelite! royal and privileged hungarian robbery.\\n\\nso bob doran comes lurching around asking bloom to tell mrs dignam he\\nwas sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and\\nto tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was\\nnever a truer, a finer than poor little willy that\\'s dead to tell her.\\nchoking with bloody foolery. and shaking bloom\\'s hand doing the tragic\\nto tell her that. shake hands, brother. you\\'re a rogue and i\\'m another.\\n\\n--let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however\\nslight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded,\\nas i hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of\\nyou this favour. but, should i have overstepped the limits of reserve\\nlet the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.\\n\\n--no, rejoined the other, i appreciate to the full the motives which\\nactuate your conduct and i shall discharge the office you entrust to\\nme consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow,\\nthis proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of\\nthe cup.\\n\\n--then suffer me to take your hand, said he. the goodness of your heart,\\ni feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words\\nthe expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose\\npoignancy, were i to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of\\nspeech.\\n\\nand off with him and out trying to walk straight. boosed at five\\no\\'clock. night he was near being lagged only paddy leonard knew the\\nbobby, 14a. blind to the world up in a shebeen in bride street after\\nclosing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking\\nporter out of teacups. and calling himself a frenchy for the shawls,\\njoseph manuo, and talking against the catholic

with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody\\nfool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls\\nscreeching laughing at one another. _how is your testament? have you got\\nan old testament?_ only paddy was passing there, i tell you what. then\\nsee him of a sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging\\nher tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no\\nless, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. jack mooney\\'s\\nsister. and the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street\\ncouples. gob, jack made him toe the line. told him if he didn\\'t patch up\\nthe pot, jesus, he\\'d kick the shite out of him.\\n\\nso terry brought the three pints.\\n\\n--here, says joe, doing the honours. here, citizen.\\n\\n--_slan leat_, says he.\\n\\n--fortune, joe, says i. good health, citizen.\\n\\ngob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. want a small\\nfortune to keep him in

alf.\\n\\n--i thought so, says joe. i saw him up at that meeting now with william\\nfield, m. p., the cattle traders.\\n\\n--hairy iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of\\nall countries and the idol of his own.\\n\\nso joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease\\nand the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen\\nsending them all to the rightabout and bloom coming out with his\\nsheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the\\nguaranteed remedy for timber tongue. because he was up one time in

commons.\\n\\n--are you sure, says bloom, the councillor is going? i wanted to see\\nhim, as it happens.\\n\\n--well, he\\'s going off by the mailboat, says joe, tonight.\\n\\n--that\\'s too bad, says bloom. i wanted particularly. perhaps only mr\\nfield is going. i couldn\\'t phone. no. you\\'re sure?\\n\\n--nannan\\'s going too, says joe. the league told him to ask a question\\ntomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding irish games in the\\npark. what do you think of that, citizen? _the sluagh na h-eireann_.\\n\\nmr cowe conacre (multifarnham. nat.): arising out of the question of\\nmy honourable friend, the member for shillelagh, may i ask the right\\nhonourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these\\nanimals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming\\nas to their pathological condition?\\n\\nmr allfours (tamoshant. con.): honourable members are already in\\npossession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole\\nhouse. i feel i cannot usefully add anything to that. the answer to the\\nhonourable member\\'s question is in the affirmative.\\n\\nmr orelli o\\'reilly (montenotte. nat.): have similar orders been issued\\nfor the slaughter of human animals who dare to play irish games in the\\nphoenix park?\\n\\nmr allfours: the answer is in the negative.\\n\\nmr cowe conacre: has the right honourable gentleman\\'s famous\\nmitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the treasury\\nbench? (o! o!)\\n\\nmr allfours: i must have notice of that question.\\n\\nmr staylewit (buncombe. ind.): don\\'t hesitate to shoot.\\n\\n(ironical opposition cheers.)\\n\\nthe speaker: order! order!\\n\\n(the house rises. cheers.)\\n\\n--there\\'s the man, says joe, that made the gaelic sports revival. there\\nhe is sitting there. the man that got away james stephens. the champion\\nof all ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. what was your best\\nthrow, citizen?\\n\\n--_na bacleis_, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. there was a\\ntime i was as good as the next fellow anyhow.\\n\\n--put it there, citizen, says joe. you were and a bloody sight better.\\n\\n--is that really a fact? says alf.\\n\\n--yes, says bloom. that\\'s well known. did you not know that?\\n\\nso off they started about irish sports and shoneen games the like of\\nlawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil\\nand building up a nation once again and all to that. and of course bloom\\nhad to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower\\'s heart violent\\nexercise was bad. i declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw\\nfrom the bloody floor and if you said to bloom: _look at, bloom. do you\\nsee that straw? that\\'s a straw_. declare to my aunt he\\'d talk about it\\nfor an hour so he would and talk steady.\\n\\na most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _brian\\no\\'ciarnain\\'s_ in _sraid na bretaine bheag_, under the auspices of\\n_sluagh na h-eireann_, on the revival of ancient gaelic sports and the\\nimportance of physical culture, as understood in ancient greece and\\nancient rome and ancient ireland, for the development of the race.\\nthe venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the\\nattendance was of large dimensions. after an instructive discourse by\\nthe chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed,\\na most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard\\nof excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of\\nthe ancient games and sports of our ancient panceltic forefathers. the\\nwellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, mr\\njoseph m\\'carthy hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of\\nthe ancient gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening\\nby finn maccool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly\\nstrength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages. l. bloom, who\\nmet with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the\\nnegative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in\\nresponse to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of\\na bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal\\nthomas osborne davis\\' evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need\\nrecalling here) _a nation once again_ in the execution of which the\\nveteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction\\nto have fairly excelled himself. the irish caruso-garibaldi was in\\nsuperlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest\\nadvantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing\\nit. his superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly\\nenhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously\\napplauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many\\nprominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press\\nand the bar and the other learned professions. the proceedings then\\nterminated.\\n\\namongst the clergy present were the very rev. william delany, s. j., l.\\nl. d.; the rt rev. gerald molloy, d. d.; the rev. p. j. kavanagh, c. s.\\nsp.; the rev. t. waters, c. c.; the rev. john m. ivers, p. p.; the rev.\\np. j. cleary, o. s. f.; the rev. l. j. hickey, o. p.; the very rev. fr.\\nnicholas, o. s. f. c.; the very rev. b. gorman,

the rev. f. t. purcell, o. p.; the very rev. timothy\\ncanon gorman, p. p.; the rev. j. flanagan, c. c. the laity included p.\\nfay, t. quirke, etc., etc.\\n\\n--talking about violent exercise, says alf, were you at that\\nkeogh-bennett match?\\n\\n--no, says joe.\\n\\n--i heard so and so made a cool hundred quid over it, says alf.\\n\\n--who? blazes? says joe.\\n\\nand says bloom:\\n\\n--what i meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training\\nthe eye.\\n\\n--ay, blazes, says alf. he let out that myler was on the beer to run up\\nthe odds and he swatting all the time.\\n\\n--we know him, says the citizen. the traitor\\'s son. we know what put\\nenglish gold in his pocket.\\n\\n---true for you, says joe.\\n\\nand bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the\\nblood, asking alf:\\n\\n--now, don\\'t you think, bergan?\\n\\n--myler dusted the floor with him, says alf. heenan and sayers was only\\na bloody fool to it. handed him the father and mother of a beating. see\\nthe little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. god,\\nhe gave him one last puck in the wind, queensberry rules and all, made\\nhim puke what he never ate.\\n\\nit was a historic and a hefty battle when myler and percy were scheduled\\nto don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. handicapped as he\\nwas by lack of poundage, dublin\\'s pet lamb made up for it by superlative\\nskill in ringcraft. the final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both\\nchampions. the welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret\\nin the previous mixup during which keogh had been receivergeneral of\\nrights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the\\npet\\'s nose, and myler came on looking groggy. the soldier got to\\nbusiness, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the irish\\ngladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of\\nbennett\\'s jaw. the redcoat ducked but the dubliner lifted him with a\\nleft hook, the body punch being a fine one. the men came to handigrips.\\nmyler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with\\nthe bulkier man on the ropes, myler punishing him. the englishman, whose\\nright eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally\\ndrenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of\\npluck, confident of knocking out the fistic eblanite in jigtime. it was\\na fight to a finish and the best man for it. the two fought like tigers\\nand excitement ran fever high. the referee twice cautioned pucking percy\\nfor holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch.\\nafter a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of\\nthe military man brought blood freely from his opponent\\'s mouth the\\nlamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to\\nbattling bennett\\'s stomach, flooring him flat. it was a knockout clean\\nand clever. amid tense expectation the portobello bruiser was being\\ncounted out when bennett\\'s second ole pfotts wettstein threw in the\\ntowel and the santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of\\nthe public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with\\ndelight.\\n\\n--he knows which side his bread is buttered, says alf. i hear he\\'s\\nrunning a concert tour now up in the north.\\n\\n--he is, says joe. isn\\'t he?\\n\\n--who? says bloom. ah, yes. that\\'s quite true. yes, a kind of summer\\ntour, you see. just a holiday.\\n\\n--mrs b. is the bright particular star, isn\\'t she? says joe.\\n\\n--my wife? says bloom. she\\'s singing, yes. i think it will be a success\\ntoo.\\n\\nhe\\'s an excellent man to organise. excellent.\\n\\nhoho begob says i to myself says i. that explains

of\\nlambert.\\n\\n--hello, ned.\\n\\n--hello, alf.\\n\\n--hello, jack.\\n\\n--hello, joe.\\n\\n--god save you, says the citizen.\\n\\n--save you kindly, says j. j. what\\'ll it be, ned?\\n\\n--half

no, sir, i\\'ll make no order for payment. how dare you,\\nsir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! a poor hardworking\\nindustrious man! i dismiss the case.\\n\\nand whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and\\nin the third week after the feastday of the holy and undivided trinity,\\nthe daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first\\nquarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the\\nhalls of law. there master courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave\\nhis rede and master justice andrews, sitting without a jury in the\\nprobate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first\\nchargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and\\nfinal testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of\\nthe late lamented jacob halliday, vintner, deceased, versus livingstone,\\nan infant, of unsound mind, and another. and to the solemn court of\\ngreen street there came sir frederick the falconer. and he sat him there\\nabout the hour of five o\\'clock to administer the law of the brehons at\\nthe commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the\\ncounty of the city of dublin. and there sat with him the high sinhedrim\\nof the twelve tribes of iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of\\npatrick and of the tribe of hugh and of the

kevin and of the tribe of caolte and of the\\ntribe of ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true. and he\\nconjured them by him who died on rood that they should well and\\ntruly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their\\nsovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict\\ngive according to the evidence so help them god and kiss the book. and\\nthey rose in their seats, those twelve of iar, and they swore by\\nthe name of him who is from everlasting that they would do his\\nrightwiseness. and straightway the minions of the law led forth from\\ntheir donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended\\nin consequence of information received. and they shackled him hand and\\nfoot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge\\nagainst him for he was a malefactor.\\n\\n--those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to ireland\\nfilling the country with bugs.\\n\\nso bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with joe,\\ntelling him he needn\\'t trouble about that little matter till the first\\nbut if he would just say a word to mr crawford. and so joe swore high\\nand holy by this and by that he\\'d do the devil and all.\\n\\n--because, you see, says bloom, for an advertisement you must have\\nrepetition. that\\'s the whole secret.\\n\\n--rely on me, says joe.\\n\\n--swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of ireland. we\\nwant no more strangers in our house.\\n\\n--o, i\\'m sure that will be all right, hynes, says bloom. it\\'s just that\\nkeyes, you see.\\n\\n--consider that done, says joe.\\n\\n--very kind of you, says bloom.\\n\\n--the strangers, says the citizen. our own fault. we let them come in.\\nwe brought them in. the adulteress and her paramour brought the saxon\\nrobbers here.\\n\\n--decree _nisi,_ says j. j.\\n\\nand bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a\\nspider\\'s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling\\nafter him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and\\nwhen.\\n\\n--a dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that\\'s what\\'s the cause of all\\nour misfortunes.\\n\\n--and here she is, says alf, that was giggling over the _police gazette_\\nwith terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.\\n\\n--give us a squint at her, says

i. get a queer old tailend of corned beef off\\nof that one, what?\\n\\nso anyhow in came john wyse nolan and lenehan with him with a face on\\nhim as long as a late breakfast.\\n\\n--well, says the citizen, what\\'s the latest from the scene of action?\\nwhat did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide\\nabout the irish language?\\n\\no\\'nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the\\npuissant and high and mighty chief of all erin and did him to wit of\\nthat which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient\\ncity, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after\\ndue prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn\\ncounsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into\\nhonour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided gael.\\n\\n--it\\'s on the march, says the citizen. to hell with the bloody brutal\\nsassenachs and their _patois._\\n\\nso j. j. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till\\nyou heard another and blinking facts and the nelson policy, putting your\\nblind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach\\na nation, and bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and\\ntheir colonies and their civilisation.\\n\\n--their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. to hell with\\nthem! the curse of a goodfornothing god light sideways on the bloody\\nthicklugged sons of whores\\' gets! no music and no art and no literature\\nworthy of the name. any civilisation they have they stole from us.\\ntonguetied sons of bastards\\' ghosts.\\n\\n--the european family, says j. j....\\n\\n--they\\'re not european, says the citizen. i was in europe with kevin\\negan of paris. you wouldn\\'t see a trace of them or their language\\nanywhere in europe except in a _cabinet d\\'aisance._\\n\\nand says john wyse:\\n\\n--full many a flower is born to blush unseen.\\n\\nand says lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:\\n\\n--_conspuez les anglais! perfide albion!_\\n\\nhe said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the\\nmedher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan _lamh\\ndearg abu_, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty\\nvalorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster\\nsilent as the deathless gods.\\n\\n--what\\'s up with you, says i to lenehan. you look like a fellow that had\\nlost a bob and found a tanner.\\n\\n--gold cup, says he.\\n\\n--who won, mr lenehan? says terry.\\n\\n_--throwaway,_ says he, at twenty to one. a rank outsider. and the rest\\nnowhere.\\n\\n--and bass\\'s mare? says terry.\\n\\n--still running, says he. we\\'re all in a cart. boylan

doran left to see if there was\\nanything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his\\nluck with his mangy snout up. old mother hubbard went to the cupboard.\\n\\n--not there, my child, says he.\\n\\n--keep your pecker up, says joe. she\\'d have won the money only for the\\nother dog.\\n\\nand j. j. and the citizen arguing about law and history with bloom\\nsticking in an odd word.\\n\\n--some people, says bloom, can see the mote in others\\' eyes but they\\ncan\\'t see the beam in their own.\\n\\n--_raimeis_, says the citizen. there\\'s no-one as blind as the fellow\\nthat won\\'t see, if you know what that means. where are our missing\\ntwenty millions of irish should be here today instead of four, our lost\\ntribes? and our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world!\\nand our wool that was sold in rome in the time of juvenal and our flax\\nand our damask from the looms of antrim and our limerick lace, our\\ntanneries and our white flint glass down there by ballybough and our\\nhuguenot poplin that we have since jacquard de lyon and our woven silk\\nand our foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the carmelite convent\\nin new ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world. where are the\\ngreek merchants that came through the pillars of hercules, the gibraltar\\nnow grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and tyrian purple to\\nsell in wexford at the fair of carmen? read tacitus and ptolemy, even\\ngiraldus cambrensis. wine, peltries, connemara marble, silver from\\ntipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today, the irish\\nhobbies, with king philip of spain offering to pay customs duties for\\nthe right to fish in our waters. what do the yellowjohns of anglia owe\\nus for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? and the beds of the\\nbarrow and shannon they won\\'t deepen with millions of acres of marsh and\\nbog to make us all die of consumption?\\n\\n--as treeless as portugal we\\'ll be

ceremony by their presence. the bride who was given away by\\nher father, the m\\'conifer of the glands, looked exquisitely charming in\\na creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip\\nof gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with\\na triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by\\nbretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze. the maids of honour, miss\\nlarch conifer and miss spruce conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very\\nbecoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being\\nworked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the\\njadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral.\\nsenhor enrique flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability\\nand, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played\\na new and striking arrangement of _woodman, spare that tree_ at the\\nconclusion of the service. on leaving the church of saint fiacre _in\\nhorto_ after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a\\nplayful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow,\\nivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. mr and mrs\\nwyse conifer neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the black forest.\\n\\n--and our eyes are on europe, says the citizen. we had our trade with\\nspain and the french and with the flemings before those mongrels were\\npupped, spanish ale in galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.\\n\\n--and will again, says joe.\\n\\n--and with the help of the holy mother of god we will again, says the\\ncitizen, clapping his thigh, our harbours that are empty will be full\\nagain, queenstown, kinsale, galway, blacksod bay, ventry in the kingdom\\nof kerry, killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with\\na fleet of masts of the galway lynches and the cavan o\\'reillys and the\\no\\'kennedys of dublin when the earl of desmond could make a treaty with\\nthe emperor charles the fifth himself. and will again, says he, when the\\nfirst irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to\\nthe fore, none of your henry tudor\\'s harps, no, the oldest flag afloat,\\nthe flag of the province of desmond and thomond, three crowns on a blue\\nfield, the three sons of milesius.\\n\\nand he took the last swig out of the pint. moya. all wind and piss like\\na tanyard cat. cows in connacht have long horns. as much as his bloody\\nlife is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled\\nmultitude in shanagolden where he daren\\'t show his nose with the molly\\nmaguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the\\nholding of an evicted tenant.\\n\\n--hear, hear to that, says john wyse. what will you have?\\n\\n--an imperial yeomanry, says lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.\\n\\n--half one, terry, says john wyse, and a hands up. terry! are you\\nasleep?\\n\\n--yes, sir, says terry. small whisky and bottle of allsop. right, sir.\\n\\nhanging over the bloody paper with alf looking for spicy bits instead of\\nattending to the general public. picture of a butting match, trying to\\ncrack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head\\ndown like a bull at a gate. and another one: _black beast burned in\\nomaha, ga_. a lot of deadwood dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a\\nsambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under\\nhim. gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and\\ncrucify him to make sure of their job.\\n\\n--but what about the fighting navy, says ned, that keeps our foes at\\nbay?\\n\\n--i\\'ll tell you what about it, says the citizen. hell upon earth it is.\\nread the revelations that\\'s going on in the papers about flogging on\\nthe training ships at portsmouth. a fellow writes that calls himself\\n_disgusted one_.\\n\\nso he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew\\nof tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the\\nparson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad\\nbrought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of\\na gun.\\n\\n--a rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir john\\nberesford called it but the modern god\\'s englishman calls it caning on\\nthe breech.\\n\\nand says john wyse:\\n\\n--\\'tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.\\n\\nthen he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane\\nand he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad\\ntill he yells meila murder.\\n\\n--that\\'s your glorious british navy, says the citizen, that bosses the\\nearth.\\n\\nthe fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber\\non the face of god\\'s earth and their land in the hands of a dozen\\ngamehogs and cottonball barons. that\\'s the great empire they boast about\\nof drudges and whipped serfs.\\n\\n--on which the sun never rises, says joe.\\n\\n--and the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. the\\nunfortunate yahoos believe it.\\n\\nthey believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth,\\nand in jacky tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast,\\nborn of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified,\\nflayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose\\nagain from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till\\nfurther orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.\\n\\n--but, says bloom, isn\\'t discipline the same everywhere. i mean wouldn\\'t\\nit be the same here if you put force against force?\\n\\ndidn\\'t i tell you? as true as i\\'m drinking this porter if he was at his\\nlast gasp he\\'d try to downface you that dying was living.\\n\\n--we\\'ll put force against force, says the citizen. we have our greater\\nireland beyond the sea. they were driven out of house and home in the\\nblack 47. their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid\\nlow by the batteringram and the _times_ rubbed its hands and told the\\nwhitelivered saxons there would soon be as few irish in ireland as\\nredskins in america. even the grand turk sent us his piastres. but the\\nsassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full\\nof crops that the british hyenas bought and sold in rio de janeiro. ay,\\nthey drove out the peasants in hordes. twenty thousand of them died in\\nthe coffinships. but those that came to the land of the free remember\\nthe land of bondage. and they will come again and with a vengeance, no\\ncravens, the sons of granuaile, the champions of kathleen ni houlihan.\\n\\n--perfectly true, says bloom. but my point was...\\n\\n--we are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says ned. since the\\npoor old woman told us that the french were on the sea and landed at\\nkillala.\\n\\n--ay, says john wyse. we fought for the royal stuarts that reneged us\\nagainst the williamites and they betrayed us. remember limerick and the\\nbroken treatystone. we gave our best blood to france and spain, the\\nwild geese. fontenoy, eh? and sarsfield and o\\'donnell, duke of tetuan\\nin spain, and ulysses browne of camus that was fieldmarshal to maria\\nteresa. but what did we ever get for it?\\n\\n--the french! says the citizen. set of dancing masters! do you know\\nwhat it is? they were never worth a roasted fart to ireland. aren\\'t they\\ntrying to make an _entente cordiale_ now at tay pay\\'s dinnerparty with\\nperfidious albion? firebrands of europe and they always were.\\n\\n--_conspuez les francais_, says lenehan, nobbling his beer.\\n\\n--and as for the prooshians and the hanoverians, says joe, haven\\'t we\\nhad enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from george the\\nelector down to the german lad and the flatulent old bitch that\\'s dead?\\n\\njesus, i had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one\\nwith the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of\\ngod, old vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting\\nher up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the\\nwhiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _ehren on the rhine_\\nand come where the boose is cheaper.\\n\\n--well, says j. j. we have edward the peacemaker now.\\n\\n--tell that to a fool, says the citizen. there\\'s a bloody sight more pox\\nthan pax about that boyo. edward guelph-wettin!\\n\\n--and what do you think, says joe, of the holy boys, the priests\\nand bishops of ireland doing up his room in maynooth in his satanic\\nmajesty\\'s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his\\njockeys rode. the earl of dublin, no less.\\n\\n--they ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little\\nalf.\\n\\nand says j. j.:\\n\\n--considerations of space influenced their lordships\\' decision.\\n\\n--will you try another, citizen? says joe.\\n\\n--yes, sir, says he. i will.\\n\\n--you? says joe.\\n\\n--beholden to you, joe, says i. may your shadow never grow less.\\n\\n--repeat that dose, says joe.\\n\\nbloom was talking and talking with john wyse and he quite excited with\\nhis dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.\\n\\n--persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.\\nperpetuating national hatred among nations.\\n\\n--but do you know what a nation means? says john wyse.\\n\\n--yes, says bloom.\\n\\n--what is it? says john wyse.\\n\\n--a nation? says bloom. a nation is the same people living in the same\\nplace.\\n\\n--by god, then, says ned, laughing, if that\\'s so i\\'m a nation for i\\'m\\nliving in the same place for the past five years.\\n\\nso of course everyone had the laugh at bloom and says he, trying to muck\\nout of it:\\n\\n--or also living in different places.\\n\\n--that covers my case, says joe.\\n\\n--what is your nation if i may ask? says the citizen.\\n\\n--ireland, says bloom. i was born here. ireland.\\n\\nthe citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and,\\ngob, he spat a red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.\\n\\n--after you with the push, joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to\\nswab himself dry.\\n\\n--here you are, citizen, says joe. take that in your right hand and\\nrepeat after me the following words.\\n\\nthe muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient irish facecloth\\nattributed to solomon of droma and manus tomaltach og macdonogh, authors\\nof the book of ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth\\nprolonged admiration. no need to dwell

symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a north american puma (a far\\nnobler king of beasts than the british article, be it said in passing),\\na kerry calf and a golden eagle from carrantuohill. the scenes depicted\\non the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs\\nand grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as\\nwonderfully beautiful and the pigments as

and mary and patrick on you, says the citizen.\\n\\nand he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.\\n\\n--we know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket.\\nwhat about sanctimonious cromwell and his ironsides that put the women\\nand children of drogheda to the sword with the bible text _god is love_\\npasted round the mouth of his cannon? the bible! did you read that skit\\nin the _united irishman_ today about that zulu chief that\\'s visiting\\nengland?\\n\\n--what\\'s that? says joe.\\n\\nso the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts\\nreading out:\\n\\n--a delegation of the chief cotton magnates of manchester was presented\\nyesterday to his majesty the alaki of abeakuta by gold stick in waiting,\\nlord walkup of walkup on eggs, to tender to his majesty the heartfelt\\nthanks of british traders for the facilities afforded them in his\\ndominions. the delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which\\nthe dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated\\nby the british chaplain, the reverend ananias praisegod barebones,\\ntendered his best thanks to massa walkup and emphasised the cordial\\nrelations existing between abeakuta and the british empire, stating that\\nhe treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible,\\nthe volume of the word of god and the secret of england\\'s greatness,\\ngraciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw\\nvictoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the royal\\ndonor. the alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the\\ntoast _black and white_ from the skull of his immediate predecessor in\\nthe dynasty kakachakachak, surnamed forty warts, after which he visited\\nthe chief factory of cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors\\'\\nbook, subsequently executing a charming old abeakutic wardance, in the\\ncourse of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious\\napplause from the girl hands.\\n\\n--widow woman, says ned. i wouldn\\'t doubt her. wonder did he put that\\nbible to the same use as i would.\\n\\n--same only more so, says lenehan. and thereafter in that fruitful land\\nthe broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.\\n\\n--is that by griffith? says john wyse.\\n\\n--no, says the citizen. it\\'s not signed shanganagh. it\\'s only\\ninitialled: p.\\n\\n--and a very good initial too, says joe.\\n\\n--that\\'s how it\\'s worked, says the citizen. trade follows the flag.\\n\\n--well, says j. j., if they\\'re any worse than those belgians in the\\ncongo free state they must be bad. did you read that report by a man\\nwhat\\'s this his name is?\\n\\n--casement, says the citizen. he\\'s an irishman.\\n\\n--yes, that\\'s the man, says j. j. raping the women and girls and\\nflogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can\\nout of them.\\n\\n--i know where he\\'s gone, says lenehan, cracking his fingers.\\n\\n--who? says i.\\n\\n--bloom, says he. the courthouse is a blind. he had a few bob on\\n_throwaway_ and he\\'s gone to gather in the shekels.\\n\\n--is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a\\nhorse in anger in his life?\\n\\n--that\\'s where he\\'s gone, says lenehan. i met bantam lyons going to back\\nthat horse only i put him off it and he told me bloom gave him the tip.\\nbet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. he\\'s the\\nonly man in dublin has it. a dark horse.\\n\\n--he\\'s a bloody dark horse himself, says joe.\\n\\n--mind, joe, says i. show us the entrance out.\\n\\n--there you are, says terry.\\n\\ngoodbye ireland i\\'m going to gort. so i just went round the back of\\nthe yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while i was\\nletting off my _(throwaway_ twenty to) letting off my load gob says i\\nto myself i knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of joe and one in\\nslattery\\'s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings\\nis five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser burke was\\ntelling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have\\ndone about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she\\'s\\nbetter_ or _she\\'s_ (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if\\nhe won or (jesus, full up i was) trading without a licence (ow!) ireland\\nmy nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there\\'s\\nthe last of it) jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.\\n\\nso anyhow when i got back they were at it dingdong, john wyse saying it\\nwas bloom gave the ideas for sinn fein to griffith to put in his paper\\nall kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off\\nof the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk\\nabout selling irish industries. robbing peter to pay paul. gob, that\\nputs the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show.\\ngive us a bloody chance. god save ireland from the likes of that bloody\\nmouseabout. mr bloom with his argol bargol. and his old fellow before\\nhim perpetrating frauds, old methusalem bloom, the robbing bagman, that\\npoisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country\\nwith his baubles and his penny diamonds. loans by post on easy terms.\\nany amount of money advanced on note of hand. distance no object. no\\nsecurity. gob, he\\'s like lanty machale\\'s goat that\\'d go a piece of the\\nroad with every one.\\n\\n--well, it\\'s a fact, says john wyse. and there\\'s the man now that\\'ll\\ntell you all about it, martin cunningham.\\n\\nsure enough the castle car drove up with martin on it and jack power\\nwith him and a fellow named crofter or crofton, pensioner out of\\nthe collector general\\'s, an orangeman blackburn does have on the\\nregistration and he drawing his pay or crawford gallivanting around the\\ncountry at the king\\'s expense.\\n\\nour travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their\\npalfreys.\\n\\n--ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.\\nsaucy knave! to us!\\n\\nso saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.\\n\\nmine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.\\n\\n--give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.\\n\\n--bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. look to our steeds.\\nand for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.\\n\\n--lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare\\nlarder. i know not what to offer your lordships.\\n\\n--how now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant\\ncountenance, so servest thou the king\\'s messengers, master taptun?\\n\\nan instantaneous change overspread the landlord\\'s visage.\\n\\n--cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. an you be the king\\'s\\nmessengers (god shield his majesty!) you shall not want for aught. the\\nking\\'s friends (god bless his majesty!) shall not go afasting in my\\nhouse i warrant me.\\n\\n--then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty\\ntrencherman by his aspect. hast aught to give us?\\n\\nmine host bowed again as he made answer:\\n\\n--what say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of\\nvenison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog\\'s bacon, a boar\\'s head\\nwith pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon\\nof old rhenish?\\n\\n--gadzooks! cried the last speaker. that likes me well. pistachios!\\n\\n--aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. a poor house and a bare\\nlarder, quotha! \\'tis a merry rogue.\\n\\nso in comes martin asking where was bloom.\\n\\n--where is he? says lenehan. defrauding widows and orphans.\\n\\n--isn\\'t that a fact, says john wyse, what i was telling the citizen\\nabout bloom and the sinn fein?\\n\\n--that\\'s so, says martin. or so they allege.\\n\\n--who made those allegations? says alf.\\n\\n--i, says joe. i\\'m the alligator.\\n\\n--and after all, says john wyse, why can\\'t a jew love his country like\\nthe next fellow?\\n\\n--why not? says j. j., when he\\'s quite sure which country it is.\\n\\n--is he a jew or a gentile or a holy roman or a swaddler or what the\\nhell is he? says ned. or who is he? no offence, crofton.\\n\\n--who is junius? says j. j.\\n\\n--we don\\'t want him, says crofter the orangeman or presbyterian.\\n\\n--he\\'s a perverted jew, says martin, from a place in hungary and it was\\nhe drew up all the plans according to the hungarian system. we know that\\nin the castle.\\n\\n--isn\\'t he a cousin of bloom the dentist? says jack power.\\n\\n--not at all, says martin. only namesakes. his name was virag, the\\nfather\\'s name that poisoned himself. he changed it by deedpoll, the\\nfather did.\\n\\n--that\\'s the new messiah for ireland! says the citizen. island of saints\\nand sages!\\n\\n--well, they\\'re still waiting for their redeemer, says martin. for that\\nmatter so are we.\\n\\n--yes, says j. j., and every male that\\'s born they think it may be their\\nmessiah. and every jew is in a tall state of excitement, i believe, till\\nhe knows if he\\'s a father or a mother.\\n\\n--expecting every moment will be his next, says lenehan.\\n\\n--o, by god, says ned, you should have seen bloom before that son of his\\nthat died was born. i met him one day in the south city markets buying a\\ntin of neave\\'s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.\\n\\n--_en ventre sa mere_, says j. j.\\n\\n--do you call that a man? says the citizen.\\n\\n--i wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says joe.\\n\\n--well, there were two children born anyhow, says jack power.\\n\\n--and who does he suspect? says the citizen.\\n\\ngob, there\\'s many a true word spoken in jest. one of those mixed\\nmiddlings he is. lying up in the hotel pisser was telling me once a\\nmonth with headache like a totty with her courses. do you know what i\\'m\\ntelling you? it\\'d be an act of god to take a hold of a fellow the like\\nof that and throw him in the bloody sea. justifiable homicide, so it\\nwould. then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of\\nstuff like a man. give us your blessing. not as much as would blind your\\neye.\\n\\n--charity to the neighbour, says martin. but where is he? we can\\'t wait.\\n\\n--a wolf in sheep\\'s clothing, says the citizen. that\\'s what he is. virag\\nfrom hungary! ahasuerus i call him. cursed by god.\\n\\n--have you time for a brief libation, martin? says ned.\\n\\n--only one, says martin. we must be quick. j. j. and s.\\n\\n--you, jack? crofton? three half ones, terry.\\n\\n--saint patrick would want to land again at ballykinlar and convert us,\\nsays the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our\\nshores.\\n\\n--well, says martin, rapping for his glass. god bless all here is my\\nprayer.\\n\\n--amen, says the citizen.\\n\\n--and i\\'m sure he will, says joe.\\n\\nand at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with\\nacolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and\\nsubdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors\\nand guardians and monks and friars: the monks of

beginneth\\n_surge, illuminare_ and thereafter most sweetly the gradual _omnes_\\nwhich saith _de saba venient_ they did divers wonders such as casting\\nout devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the\\nhalt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid,\\ninterpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying.\\nand last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend father\\no\\'flynn attended by malachi and patrick. and when the good fathers\\nhad reached the appointed place, the house of bernard kiernan and co,\\nlimited, 8, 9 and 10 little britain street, wholesale grocers, wine\\nand brandy shippers, licensed fo the sale of beer, wine and spirits for\\nconsumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed\\nthe mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and\\nthe capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches\\nand the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with\\nblessed water and prayed that god might bless that house as he had\\nblessed the house of abraham and isaac and jacob and make the angels of\\nhis light to inhabit therein. and entering he blessed the viands and the\\nbeverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.\\n\\n--_adiutorium nostrum in nomine domini._\\n\\n--_qui fecit coelum et terram._\\n\\n--_dominus vobiscum._\\n\\n--_et cum spiritu tuo._\\n\\nand he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed\\nand they all with him prayed:\\n\\n--_deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde\\nsuper creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et\\nvoluntatem tuam cum gratiarum actione usus

year, lambert, says crofton or crawford.\\n\\n--right, says ned, taking up his john jameson. and butter for fish.\\n\\ni was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when\\nbe damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.\\n\\n--i was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. i hope\\ni\\'m not...\\n\\n--no, says martin, we\\'re ready.\\n\\ncourthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.\\nmean bloody scut. stand us a drink itself. devil a sweet fear! there\\'s\\na jew for you! all for number one. cute as a shithouse rat. hundred to\\nfive.\\n\\n--don\\'t tell anyone, says the citizen,\\n\\n--beg your pardon, says he.\\n\\n--come on boys, says martin, seeing it was looking blue. come along now.\\n\\n--don\\'t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. it\\'s a\\nsecret.\\n\\nand the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.\\n\\n--bye bye all, says martin.\\n\\nand he got them out as quick as he could, jack power and crofton or\\nwhatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all\\nat sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.\\n\\n---off with you, says\\n\\nmartin to the jarvey.\\n\\nthe milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the\\nhelmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward\\nwith all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. a many comely nymphs drew\\nnigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of\\nthe noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning\\nwheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the\\nequidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them\\nall with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they\\nride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. even so did\\nthey come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters. and\\nthey laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the\\nwaves.\\n\\nbut begob i was just lowering the heel of the pint when i saw the\\ncitizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the\\ndropsy, and he cursing the curse of cromwell on him, bell, book and\\ncandle in irish, spitting and spatting out of him and joe and little alf\\nround him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.\\n\\n--let me alone, says he.\\n\\nand begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls\\nout of him:\\n\\n--three cheers for israel!\\n\\narrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for christ\\' sake\\nand don\\'t be making a public exhibition of yourself. jesus, there\\'s\\nalways some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about\\nbloody nothing. gob, it\\'d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it\\nwould.\\n\\nand all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and\\nmartin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and alf\\nand joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and\\nthe loafers calling for a speech and jack power trying to get him to sit\\ndown on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over\\nhis eye starts singing _if the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew_ and\\na slut shouts out of her:\\n\\n--eh, mister! your fly is open, mister!\\n\\nand says he:\\n\\n--mendelssohn was a jew and karl marx and mercadante and spinoza. and\\nthe saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. your god.\\n\\n--he had no father, says martin. that\\'ll do now. drive ahead.\\n\\n--whose god? says the citizen.\\n\\n--well, his uncle was a jew, says he. your god was a jew. christ was a\\njew like me.\\n\\ngob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.\\n\\n--by jesus, says he, i\\'ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy\\nname.\\n\\nby jesus, i\\'ll crucify him so i will. give us that biscuitbox here.\\n\\n--stop! stop! says joe.\\n\\na large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from\\nthe metropolis and greater dublin assembled in their thousands to bid\\nfarewell to nagyasagos uram lipoti virag, late of messrs alexander\\nthom\\'s, printers to his majesty, on the occasion of his departure\\nfor the distant clime of szazharminczbrojugulyas-dugulas (meadow of\\nmurmuring waters). the ceremony which went off with great _eclat_ was\\ncharacterised by the most affecting cordiality. an illuminated scroll\\nof ancient irish vellum, the work of irish artists, was presented to\\nthe distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the\\ncommunity and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully\\nexecuted in the style of ancient celtic ornament, a work which reflects\\nevery credit on the makers, messrs jacob _agus_ jacob. the departing\\nguest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were\\npresent being visibly moved when the select orchestra of irish pipes\\nstruck up the wellknown strains of _come back to erin_, followed\\nimmediately by _rakoczsy\\'s march_. tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted\\nalong the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the hill of\\nhowth, three rock mountain, sugarloaf, bray head, the mountains of\\nmourne, the galtees, the ox and donegal and sperrin peaks, the nagles\\nand the bograghs, the connemara hills, the reeks of m gillicuddy, slieve\\naughty, slieve bernagh and slieve bloom. amid cheers that rent the\\nwelkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of\\nhenchmen on the distant cambrian and caledonian hills, the mastodontic\\npleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from\\nthe representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers\\nwhile, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges,\\nthe flags of the ballast office and custom house were dipped in salute\\nas were also those of the electrical power station at the\\npigeonhouse and the poolbeg light. _visszontlatasra, kedves baraton!\\nvisszontlatasra!_ gone but not forgotten.\\n\\ngob, the devil wouldn\\'t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin\\nanyhow and out with him and little alf hanging on to his elbow and he\\nshouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the queen\\'s\\nroyal theatre:\\n\\n--where is he till i murder him?\\n\\nand ned and j. j. paralysed with the laughing.\\n\\n--bloody wars, says i, i\\'ll be in for the last gospel.\\n\\nbut as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag\\'s head round the other\\nway and off with him.\\n\\n--hold on, citizen, says joe. stop!\\n\\nbegob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. mercy of god the\\nsun was in his eyes or he\\'d have left him for dead. gob, he near sent it\\ninto the county longford. the bloody nag took fright and the old\\nmongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and\\nlaughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.\\n\\nthe catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. the\\nobservatory of dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth\\ngrade of mercalli\\'s scale, and there is no record extant of a similar\\nseismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year\\nof the rebellion of silken thomas. the epicentre appears to have been\\nthat part of the metropolis which constitutes the inn\\'s quay ward and\\nparish of saint michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods\\nand one square pole or perch. all the lordly residences in the vicinity\\nof the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself,\\nin which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in\\nprogress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be\\nfeared all the occupants have been buried alive. from the reports of\\neyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by\\na violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. an article of\\nheadgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the\\ncrown and peace mr george fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle\\nwith the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of\\nthe erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir frederick\\nfalkiner, recorder of dublin, have been discovered by search parties\\nin remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third\\nbasaltic ridge of the giant\\'s causeway, the latter embedded to the\\nextent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of holeopen bay near\\nthe old head of kinsale. other eyewitnesses depose that they observed\\nan incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the\\natmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest\\nby west. messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received\\nfrom all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has\\nbeen graciously pleased to decree that a special _missa pro defunctis_\\nshall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every\\ncathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual\\nauthority of the holy see in suffrage of the souls of those faithful\\ndeparted who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst.\\nthe work of salvage, removal of _debris,_ human remains etc has been\\nentrusted to messrs michael meade and son, 159 great brunswick street,\\nand messrs t. and c. martin, 77, 78, 79 and 80 north wall,

oaths after him.\\n\\n--did i kill him, says he, or what?\\n\\nand he shouting to the bloody dog:\\n\\n--after him, garry! after him, boy!\\n\\nand the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old\\nsheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his\\nlugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb.\\nhundred to five! jesus, he took the value of it out of him, i promise\\nyou.\\n\\nwhen, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld\\nthe chariot wherein he stood ascend to heaven. and they beheld him in\\nthe chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment\\nas of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not\\nlook upon him. and there came a voice out of heaven, calling: _elijah!\\nelijah!_ and he answered with a main cry: _abba! adonai!_ and they\\nbeheld him even him, ben bloom elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend\\nto the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over\\ndonohoe\\'s in little green street like a shot off a shovel.\\n\\n\\n\\nthe summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious\\nembrace. far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of\\nall too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud\\npromontory of dear old howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on\\nthe weedgrown rocks along sandymount shore and, last but not least, on\\nthe quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness\\nthe voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to\\nthe stormtossed heart of man, mary, star of the sea.\\n\\nthe three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening\\nscene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly. many a time and\\noft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy\\nchat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, cissy\\ncaffrey and edy boardman with the baby in the pushcar and tommy and\\njacky caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with\\ncaps to match and the name h.m.s. belleisle printed on both. for tommy\\nand jacky caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and\\nspoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with\\nbright merry faces and endearing ways about them. they were dabbling in\\nthe sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do,\\nor playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long. and\\nedy boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while\\nthat young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight. he was but eleven\\nmonths and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just\\nbeginning to lisp his first babyish words. cissy caffrey bent over to\\nhim to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.\\n\\n--now, baby, cissy caffrey said. say out big, big. i want a drink of\\nwater.\\n\\nand baby prattled after her:\\n\\n--a jink a jink a jawbo.\\n\\ncissy caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children,\\nso patient with little sufferers and tommy caffrey could never be got to\\ntake his castor oil unless it was cissy caffrey that held his nose and\\npromised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden\\nsyrup on. what a persuasive power that girl had! but to be sure baby\\nboardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy\\nbib. none of your spoilt beauties, flora macflimsy sort, was cissy\\ncaffrey. a truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with\\na laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe\\nred lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. and edy boardman laughed too at\\nthe quaint language of little brother.\\n\\nbut just then there was a slight altercation between master tommy and\\nmaster jacky. boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception\\nto this golden rule. the apple of discord was a certain castle of sand\\nwhich master jacky had built and master tommy would have it right go\\nwrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the\\nmartello tower had. but if master tommy was headstrong master jacky was\\nselfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little irishman\\'s house\\nis his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the\\nwouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle\\ntoo. needless to say the cries of discomfited master tommy drew the\\nattention of the girl friends.\\n\\n--come here, tommy, his sister called imperatively. at once! and you,\\njacky, for shame to throw poor tommy in the dirty sand. wait till i\\ncatch you for that.\\n\\nhis eyes misty with unshed tears master tommy came at her call for their\\nbig sister\\'s word was law with the twins. and in a sad plight he was\\ntoo after his misadventure. his little man-o\\'-war top and unmentionables\\nwere full of sand but cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing\\nover life\\'s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to\\nbe seen on his smart little suit. still the blue eyes were glistening\\nwith hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and\\nshook her hand at master jacky the culprit and said if she was near him\\nshe wouldn\\'t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.\\n\\n--nasty bold jacky! she cried.\\n\\nshe put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:\\n\\n--what\\'s your name? butter and cream?\\n\\n--tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke edy boardman. is cissy your\\nsweetheart?\\n\\n--nao, tearful tommy said.\\n\\n--is edy boardman your sweetheart? cissy queried.\\n\\n--nao, tommy said.\\n\\n--i know, edy boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from\\nher shortsighted eyes. i know who is tommy\\'s sweetheart. gerty is\\ntommy\\'s sweetheart.\\n\\n--nao, tommy said on the verge of tears.\\n\\ncissy\\'s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to\\nedy boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman\\ncouldn\\'t see and to mind he didn\\'t wet his new tan shoes.\\n\\nbut who was gerty?\\n\\ngerty macdowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought,\\ngazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen\\nof winsome irish girlhood as one could wish to see. she was pronounced\\nbeautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was\\nmore a giltrap than a macdowell. her figure was slight and graceful,\\ninclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking\\nof late had done her a world of good much better than the widow welch\\'s\\nfemale pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to\\nget and that tired feeling. the waxen pallor of her face was almost\\nspiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine\\ncupid\\'s bow, greekly perfect. her hands were of finely veined alabaster\\nwith tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments\\ncould make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves\\nin bed or take a milk footbath either. bertha supple told that once to\\nedy boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn\\nwith gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to\\ntime like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever\\nshe did that it was her that told her or she\\'d never speak to her\\nagain. no. honour where honour is due. there was an innate refinement,\\na languid queenly _hauteur_ about gerty which was unmistakably evidenced\\nin her delicate hands and higharched instep. had kind fate but willed\\nher to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had\\nshe only received the benefit of a good education gerty macdowell might\\neasily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen\\nherself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors\\nat her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her.\\nmayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her\\nsoftlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning,\\nthat imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm\\nfew could resist. why have women such eyes of witchery? gerty\\'s were of\\nthe bluest irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive\\nbrows. time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive. it\\nwas madame vera verity, directress of the woman beautiful page of the\\nprincess novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which\\ngave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders\\nof fashion, and she had never regretted it. then there was blushing\\nscientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you\\nhave a beautiful face but your nose? that would suit mrs dignam because\\nshe had a button one. but gerty\\'s crowning glory was her wealth of\\nwonderful hair. it was dark brown with a natural wave in it. she had cut\\nit that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about\\nher pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails\\ntoo, thursday for wealth. and just now at edy\\'s words as a telltale\\nflush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she\\nlooked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety god\\'s\\nfair land of ireland did not hold her equal.\\n\\nfor an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. she\\nwas about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.\\ninclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.\\nthe pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into\\na joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young may\\nmorning. she knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty edy\\nsay that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a\\nlovers\\' quarrel. as per usual somebody\\'s nose was out of joint about the\\nboy that had the bicycle off the london bridge road always riding up\\nand down in front of her window. only now his father kept him in in the\\nevenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was\\non and he was going to go to trinity college to study for a doctor when\\nhe left the high school like his brother w. e. wylie who was racing\\nin the bicycle races in trinity college university. little recked he\\nperhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes,\\npiercing to the core. yet he was young and perchance he might learn\\nto love her in time. they were protestants in his family and of course\\ngerty knew who came first and after him the blessed virgin and then\\nsaint joseph. but he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and\\nhe was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too\\nat the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something\\noff the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his\\nhands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes\\nand besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why edy\\nboardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn\\'t go and\\nride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.\\n\\ngerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of\\ndame fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be\\nout. a neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it\\nwas expected in the _lady\\'s pictorial_ that electric blue would be worn)\\nwith a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in\\nwhich she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her\\nfavourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy\\nthreequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure\\nto perfection. she wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved\\nnigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and\\nat the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone. all tuesday week afternoon\\nshe was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she\\nwanted at clery\\'s summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you\\nwould never notice, seven fingers two and a penny. she did it up all by\\nherself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the\\nlovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! and when she put\\nit on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the\\nshine out of some people she knew. her shoes were the newest thing in\\nfootwear (edy boardman prided herself that she was very _petite_ but she\\nnever had a foot like gerty macdowell, a five, and never would ash,\\noak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over\\nher higharched instep. her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect\\nproportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of\\nher shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and\\nwide garter tops. as for undies they were gerty\\'s chief care and who\\nthat knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though\\ngerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to\\nblame her? she had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery,\\nthree garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different\\ncoloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired\\nthem herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed\\nthem and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn\\'t\\ntrust those washerwomen as far as she\\'d see them scorching the things.\\nshe was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour\\nand lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because\\nthe green she wore that day week brought grief because his father\\nbrought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because\\nshe thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that\\nmorning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that\\nwas for luck and lovers\\' meeting if you put those things on inside\\nout or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it\\nwasn\\'t of a friday.\\n\\nand yet and yet! that strained look on her face! a gnawing sorrow is\\nthere all the time. her very soul is in her eyes and she would give\\nworlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where,\\ngiving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup\\nfeelingsthough not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before\\nthe mirror. you are lovely, gerty, it said. the paly light of evening\\nfalls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful. gerty macdowell yearns\\nin vain. yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a\\nmarriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for mrs reggy\\nwylie t. c. d. (because the one who married the elder brother would be\\nmrs wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence mrs gertrude wylie was\\nwearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox\\nwas not to be. he was too young to understand. he would not believe in\\nlove, a woman\\'s birthright. the night of the party long ago in stoer\\'s\\n(he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole\\nan arm round her waist she went white to the very lips. he called her\\nlittle one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the\\nfirst!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from\\nthe room with a remark about refreshments. impetuous fellow! strength of\\ncharacter had never been reggy wylie\\'s strong point and he who would\\nwoo and win gerty macdowell must be a man among men. but waiting, always\\nwaiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over. no\\nprince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her\\nfeet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found\\nhis ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would\\nunderstand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all\\nthe strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long\\nlong kiss. it would be like heaven. for such a one she yearns this balmy\\nsummer eve. with all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his\\naffianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death\\nus two part, from this to this day forward.\\n\\nand while edy boardman was with little tommy behind the pushcar she was\\njust thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his\\nlittle wife to be. then they could talk about her till they went blue in\\nthe face, bertha supple too, and edy, little spitfire, because she would\\nbe twentytwo in november. she would care for him with creature comforts\\ntoo for gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that\\nfeeling of hominess. her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and\\nqueen ann\\'s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions\\nfrom all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge\\nin the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction,\\nthen cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though\\nshe didn\\'t like the eating part when there were any people that made her\\nshy and often she wondered why you couldn\\'t eat something poetical like\\nviolets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom\\nwith pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa giltrap\\'s\\nlovely dog garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz\\ncovers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in clery\\'s summer\\njumble sales like they have in rich houses. he would be tall with\\nbroad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with\\nglistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache\\nand they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful\\nweeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little\\nhomely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but\\nperfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to\\nbusiness he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze\\nfor a moment deep down into her eyes.\\n\\nedy boardman asked tommy caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she\\nbuttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off\\nand play with jacky and to be good now and not to fight. but tommy said\\nhe wanted the ball and edy told him no that baby was playing with the\\nball and if he took it there\\'d be wigs on the green but tommy said it\\nwas his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if\\nyou please. the temper of him! o, he was a man already was little tommy\\ncaffrey since he was out of pinnies. edy told him no, no and to be off\\nnow with him and she told cissy caffrey not to give in to him.\\n\\n--you\\'re not my sister, naughty tommy said. it\\'s my ball.\\n\\nbut cissy caffrey told baby boardman to look up, look up high at her\\nfinger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and\\ntommy after it in full career, having won the day.\\n\\n--anything for a quiet life, laughed ciss.\\n\\nand she tickled tiny tot\\'s two cheeks to make him forget and played\\nhere\\'s the lord mayor, here\\'s his two horses, here\\'s his gingerbread\\ncarriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper\\nchin. but edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way\\nlike that from everyone always petting him.\\n\\n--i\\'d like to give him something, she said, so i would, where i won\\'t\\nsay.\\n\\n--on the beeoteetom, laughed cissy merrily.\\n\\ngerty macdowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of cissy\\nsaying an unladylike thing like that out loud she\\'d be ashamed of her\\nlife to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and edy boardman said she was\\nsure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. but not a pin cared\\nciss.\\n\\n--let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of\\nher nose. give it to him too on the same place as quick as i\\'d look at\\nhim.\\n\\nmadcap ciss with her golliwog curls. you had to laugh at her sometimes.\\nfor instance when she asked you would you have some more chinese tea and\\njaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men\\'s faces on her\\nnails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go\\nwhere you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the miss\\nwhite. that was just like cissycums. o, and will you ever forget her the\\nevening she dressed up in her father\\'s suit and hat and the burned cork\\nmoustache and walked down tritonville road, smoking a cigarette. there\\nwas none to come up to her for fun. but she was sincerity itself, one of\\nthe bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced\\nthings, too sweet to be wholesome.\\n\\nand then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing\\nanthem of the organ. it was the men\\'s temperance retreat conducted\\nby the missioner, the reverend john hughes s. j., rosary, sermon and\\nbenediction of the most blessed sacrament. they were there gathered\\ntogether without distinction of social class (and a most edifying\\nspectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the\\nstorms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate,\\nreciting the litany of our lady of loreto, beseeching her to intercede\\nfor them, the old familiar words, holy mary, holy virgin of virgins. how\\nsad to poor gerty\\'s ears! had her father only avoided the clutches of\\nthe demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit\\ncured in pearson\\'s weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage,\\nsecond to none. over and over had she told herself that as she mused by\\nthe dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two\\nlights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at\\nthe rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking. but that vile decoction\\nwhich has ruined so many hearths and homes had cist its shadow over her\\nchildhood days. nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of\\nviolence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to\\nthe fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was\\none thing of all things that gerty knew it was that the man who lifts\\nhis hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded\\nas the lowest of the low.\\n\\nand still the voices sang in supplication to the virgin most powerful,\\nvirgin most merciful. and gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard\\nher companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman\\noff sandymount green that cissy caffrey called the man that was so like\\nhimself passing along the strand taking a short walk. you never saw him\\nany way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a\\nfather because he was too old or something or on account of his face\\n(it was a palpable case of doctor fell) or his carbuncly nose with the\\npimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose. poor\\nfather! with all his faults she loved him still when he sang _tell me,\\nmary, how to woo thee_ or _my love and cottage near rochelle_ and they\\nhad stewed cockles and lettuce with lazenby\\'s salad dressing for\\nsupper and when he sang _the moon hath raised_ with mr dignam that\\ndied suddenly and was buried, god have mercy on him, from a stroke. her\\nmother\\'s birthday that was and charley was home on his holidays and tom\\nand mr dignam and mrs and patsy and freddy dignam and they were to have\\nhad a group taken. no-one would have thought the end was so near. now he\\nwas laid to rest. and her mother said to him to let that be a warning to\\nhim for the rest of his days and he couldn\\'t even go to the funeral on\\naccount of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the\\nletters and samples from his office about catesby\\'s cork lino, artistic,\\nstandard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright\\nand cheery in the home.\\n\\na sterling good daughter was gerty just like a second mother in the\\nhouse, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in\\ngold. and when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was\\nit rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but gerty though she didn\\'t\\nlike her mother\\'s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single\\nthing they ever had words about, taking snuff. everyone thought the\\nworld of her for her gentle ways. it was gerty who turned off the gas at\\nthe main every night and it was gerty who tacked up on the wall of that\\nplace where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime mr\\ntunney the grocer\\'s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days\\nwhere a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a\\nthreecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with\\noldtime chivalry through her lattice window. you could see there was a\\nstory behind it. the colours were done something lovely. she was in\\na soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in\\nchocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat. she often looked at them\\ndreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own\\narms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back\\nand thought about those times because she had found out in walker\\'s\\npronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa giltrap about the\\nhalcyon days what they meant.\\n\\nthe twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion\\ntill at last master jacky who was really as bold as brass there was\\nno getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he\\ncould down towards the seaweedy rocks. needless to say poor tommy was\\nnot slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was\\nsitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted\\nthe ball. our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and\\nto avoid trouble cissy caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to\\nher please. the gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw\\nit up the strand towards cissy caffrey but it rolled down the slope and\\nstopped right under gerty\\'s skirt near the little pool by the rock. the\\ntwins clamoured again for it and cissy told her to kick it away and\\nlet them fight for it so gerty drew back her foot but she wished their\\nstupid ball hadn\\'t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she\\nmissed and edy and cissy laughed.\\n\\n--if you fail try again, edy boardman said.\\n\\ngerty smiled assent and bit her lip. a delicate pink crept into her\\npretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted\\nher skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a\\njolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down\\ntowards the shingle. pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw\\nattention on account of the gentleman opposite looking. she felt the\\nwarm flush, a danger signal always with gerty macdowell, surging and\\nflaming into her cheeks. till then they had only exchanged glances of\\nthe most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a\\nlook at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan\\nand strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.\\n\\nthrough the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted\\nand with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of\\noriginal sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray\\nfor us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. and\\ncareworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many\\nwho had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all\\nthat bright with hope for the reverend father father hughes had told\\nthem what the great saint bernard said in his famous prayer of mary, the\\nmost pious virgin\\'s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any\\nage that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned\\nby her.\\n\\nthe twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of\\nchildhood are but as fleeting summer showers. cissy caffrey played with\\nbaby boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air. peep\\nshe cried behind the hood of the pushcar and edy asked where was cissy\\ngone and then cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word,\\ndidn\\'t the little chap enjoy that! and then she told him to say papa.\\n\\n--say papa, baby. say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.\\n\\nand baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for\\neleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of\\nhealth, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out\\nto be something great, they said.\\n\\n--haja ja ja haja.\\n\\ncissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to\\nsit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried\\nout, holy saint denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half\\nblanket the other way under him. of course his infant majesty was most\\nobstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:\\n\\n--habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.\\n\\nand two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. it was all\\nno use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the\\ngeegee and where was the puffpuff but ciss, always readywitted, gave\\nhim in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was\\nquickly appeased.\\n\\ngerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out\\nof that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little\\nbrats of twins. she gazed out towards the distant sea. it was like the\\npaintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured\\nchalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the\\nevening and the clouds coming out and the bailey light on howth and to\\nhear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned\\nin the church like a kind of waft. and while she gazed her heart went\\npitapat. yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his\\nlook. his eyes burned into her as though they would search her through\\nand through, read her very soul. wonderful eyes they were, superbly\\nexpressive, but could you trust them? people were so queer. she could\\nsee at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he\\nwas a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of martin harvey, the\\nmatinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she\\nwasn\\'t stagestruck like winny rippingham that wanted they two to always\\ndress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had\\nan aquiline nose or a slightly _retrousse_ from where he was sitting.\\nhe was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting\\nsorrow was written on his face. she would have given worlds to know what\\nit was. he was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the\\nball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if\\nshe swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down. she was glad\\nthat something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking\\nreggy wylie might be out but that was far away. here was that of which\\nshe had so often dreamed. it was he who mattered and there was joy on\\nher face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he\\nwas like no-one else. the very heart of the girlwoman went out to him,\\nher dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him. if he had\\nsuffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had\\nbeen himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not. even if he was a\\nprotestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved\\nher. there were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm. she was a\\nwomanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known,\\nthose cyclists showing off what they hadn\\'t got and she just yearned to\\nknow all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her,\\nmake him forget the memory of the past. then mayhap he would embrace her\\ngently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her,\\nhis ownest girlie, for herself alone.\\n\\nrefuge of sinners. comfortress of the afflicted. _ora pro nobis_. well\\nhas it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy\\ncan never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge\\nfor the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced\\nher own heart. gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the\\nstained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue\\nbanners of the blessed virgin\\'s sodality and father conroy was helping\\ncanon o\\'hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes\\ncast down. he looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet\\nand clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever\\nshe became a dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to\\nthe convent for the novena of saint dominic. he told her that time when\\nshe told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her\\nhair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the\\nvoice of nature and we were all subject to nature\\'s laws, he said, in\\nthis life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of\\nwoman instituted by god, he said, and that our blessed lady herself said\\nto the archangel gabriel be it done unto me according to thy word. he\\nwas so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could\\nshe work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a\\npresent or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece\\nwhite and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell\\nthe time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours\\'\\nadoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or\\nperhaps an album of illuminated views of dublin or some place.\\n\\nthe exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and jacky\\nthrew the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. little\\nmonkeys common as ditchwater. someone ought to take them and give them\\na good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of\\nthem. and cissy and edy shouted after them to come back because they\\nwere afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.\\n\\n--jacky! tommy!\\n\\nnot they! what a great notion they had! so cissy said it was the very\\nlast time she\\'d ever bring them out. she jumped up and called them and\\nshe ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had\\na good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the\\nthingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn\\'t get it to grow\\nlong because it wasn\\'t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at\\nit. she ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn\\'t rip up\\nher skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot\\nof the tomboy about cissy caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever\\nshe thought she had a good opportunity to show and just because she was\\na good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her\\npetticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible. it\\nwould have served her just right if she had tripped up over something\\naccidentally on purpose with her high crooked french heels on her to\\nmake her look tall and got a fine tumble. _tableau!_ that would have\\nbeen a very charming expose for a gentleman like that to witness.\\n\\nqueen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints,\\nthey prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then father conroy handed\\nthe thurible to canon o\\'hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the\\nblessed sacrament and cissy caffrey caught the two twins and she was\\nitching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn\\'t\\nbecause she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger\\nmistake in all her life because gerty could see without looking that\\nhe never took his eyes off of her and then canon o\\'hanlon handed the\\nthurible back to father conroy and knelt down looking up at the blessed\\nsacrament and the choir began to sing the _tantum ergo_ and she just\\nswung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to\\nthe _tantumer gosa cramen tum_. three and eleven she paid for those\\nstockings in sparrow\\'s of george\\'s street on the tuesday, no the monday\\nbefore easter and there wasn\\'t a brack on them and that was what he\\nwas looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had\\nneither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his\\nhead to see the difference for himself.\\n\\ncissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with\\nher hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a\\nstreel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only\\na fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat\\nhanging like a caricature. gerty just took off her hat for a moment to\\nsettle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was\\nnever seen on a girl\\'s shoulders--a radiant little vision, in sooth,\\nalmost maddening in its sweetness. you would have to travel many a long\\nmile before you found a head of hair the like of that. she could almost\\nsee the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her\\ntingling in every nerve. she put on her hat so that she could see from\\nunderneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath\\ncaught as she caught the expression in his eyes. he was eying her as a\\nsnake eyes its prey. her woman\\'s instinct told her that she had raised\\nthe devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat\\nto brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.\\n\\nedy boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at gerty,\\nhalf smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the\\nbaby. irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why\\nno-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of\\nhers. and she said to gerty:\\n\\n--a penny for your thoughts.\\n\\n--what? replied gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth. i\\nwas only wondering was it late.\\n\\nbecause she wished to goodness they\\'d take the snottynosed twins and\\ntheir babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just\\ngave a gentle hint about its being late. and when cissy came up edy\\nasked her the time and miss cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half\\npast kissing time, time to kiss again. but edy wanted to know because\\nthey were told to be in early.\\n\\n--wait, said cissy, i\\'ll run ask my uncle peter over there what\\'s the\\ntime by his conundrum.\\n\\nso over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his\\nhand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his\\nwatchchain, looking up at the church. passionate nature though he was\\ngerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. one moment he\\nhad been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the\\nnext moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed\\nin every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.\\n\\ncissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the\\nright time and gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it\\nand looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his\\nwatch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the\\nsun was set. his voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in\\nmeasured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.\\ncissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said\\nhis waterworks were out of order.\\n\\nthen they sang the second verse of the _tantum ergo_ and canon o\\'hanlon\\ngot up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and he told\\nfather conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the\\nflowers and father conroy got up and settled it all right and she could\\nsee the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she\\nswung her leg more in and out in time. it was getting darker but he\\ncould see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch\\nor whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands\\nback into his pockets. she felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over\\nher and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against\\nher stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too\\nwas when she clipped her hair on account of the moon. his dark eyes\\nfixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally\\nworshipping at her shrine. if ever there was undisguised admiration in a\\nman\\'s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man\\'s face.\\nit is for you, gertrude macdowell, and you know it.\\n\\nedy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and gerty\\nnoticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect\\nbecause it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place\\nto push up the pushcar and cissy took off the twins\\' caps and tidied\\ntheir hair to make herself attractive of course and canon o\\'hanlon stood\\nup with his cope poking up at his neck and father conroy handed him the\\ncard to read off and he read out _panem de coelo praestitisti eis_ and\\nedy and cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her\\nbut gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered\\nwith scathing politeness when edy asked her was she heartbroken about\\nher best boy throwing her over. gerty winced sharply. a brief cold blaze\\nshone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable. it hurt--o\\nyes, it cut deep because edy had her own quiet way of saying things\\nlike that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was.\\ngerty\\'s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back\\nthe sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully\\nmoulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of. she had loved him\\nbetter than he knew. lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex\\nhe would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant\\nthere was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears. their eyes were\\nprobing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in\\nsympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.\\n\\n--o, responded gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head\\nflashed up. i can throw my cap at who i like because it\\'s leap year.\\n\\nher words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the\\nringdove, but they cut the silence icily. there was that in her young\\nvoice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. as\\nfor mr reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck\\nhim aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as\\nmuch as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen\\npieces. and if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one\\nlook of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot. miss\\npuny little edy\\'s countenance fell to no slight extent and gerty could\\nsee by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering\\nrage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had\\nstruck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was\\nsomething aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and\\nnever would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it\\nso they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.\\n\\nedy straightened up baby boardman to get ready to go and cissy tucked in\\nthe ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the\\nsandman was on his way for master boardman junior. and cissy told him\\ntoo that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby\\nlooked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and cissy\\npoked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as\\nmuch as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to\\nhis brandnew dribbling bib.\\n\\n--o my! puddeny pie! protested ciss. he has his bib destroyed.\\n\\nthe slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set\\nthat little matter to rights.\\n\\ngerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and edy\\nasked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was\\nflying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed\\nit off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction\\nbecause just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet\\nseashore because canon o\\'hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that\\nfather conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the\\nblessed sacrament in his hands.\\n\\nhow moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse\\nof erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same\\ntime a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither,\\nthither, with a tiny lost cry. and she could see far away the lights of\\nthe lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of\\npaints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter\\nwould be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along\\nby shady tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the\\nlamp near her window where reggy wylie used to turn his freewheel like\\nshe read in that book _the lamplighter_ by miss cummins, author of\\n_mabel vaughan_ and other tales. for gerty had her dreams that no-one\\nknew of. she loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from\\nbertha supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover\\nto write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable\\nwhich, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously\\nneat and clean. it was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the\\ntortoiseshell combs, her child of mary badge, the whiterose scent, the\\neyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change\\nwhen her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful\\nthoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in hely\\'s of dame\\nstreet for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only\\nexpress herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that\\nshe had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the\\npotherbs. _art thou real, my ideal?_ it was called by louis j walsh,\\nmagherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt thou\\never?_ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient\\nloveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that\\nthe years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one\\nshortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an\\naccident coming down dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.\\nbut it must end, she felt. if she saw that magic lure in his eyes there\\nwould be no holding back for her. love laughs at locksmiths. she\\nwould make the great sacrifice. her every effort would be to share his\\nthoughts. dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his\\ndays with happiness. there was the allimportant question and she was\\ndying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife\\nor some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land\\nof song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind.\\nbut even if--what then? would it make a very great difference? from\\neverything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively\\nrecoiled. she loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the\\naccommodation walk beside the dodder that went with the soldiers and\\ncoarse men with no respect for a girl\\'s honour, degrading the sex and\\nbeing taken up to the police station. no, no: not that. they would be\\njust good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other\\nin spite of the conventions of society with a big ess. perhaps it was\\nan old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall. she\\nthought she understood. she would try to understand him because men were\\nso different. the old love was waiting, waiting with little white\\nhands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes. heart of mine! she would\\nfollow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he\\nwas her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was\\nthe master guide. nothing else mattered. come what might she would be\\nwild, untrammelled, free.\\n\\ncanon o\\'hanlon put the blessed sacrament back into the tabernacle and\\ngenuflected and the choir sang _laudate dominum omnes gentes_ and then\\nhe locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and\\nfather conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat edy asked wasn\\'t\\nshe coming but jacky caffrey called out:\\n\\n--o, look, cissy!\\n\\nand they all looked was it sheet lightning but tommy saw it too over the\\ntrees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.\\n\\n--it\\'s fireworks, cissy caffrey said.\\n\\nand they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,\\nhelterskelter, edy with the pushcar with baby boardman in it and cissy\\nholding tommy and jacky by the hand so they wouldn\\'t fall running.\\n\\n--come on, gerty, cissy called. it\\'s the bazaar fireworks.\\n\\nbut gerty was adamant. she had no intention of being at their beck and\\ncall. if they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could\\nsee from where she was. the eyes that were fastened upon her set her\\npulses tingling. she looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and\\na light broke in upon her. whitehot passion was in that face, passion\\nsilent as the grave, and it had made her his. at last they were left\\nalone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could\\nbe trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible\\nhonour to his fingertips. his hands and face were working and a tremour\\nwent over her. she leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were\\nand she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up\\nand there was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed all her\\ngraceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately\\nrounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse\\nbreathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that,\\nhotblooded, because bertha supple told her once in dead secret and made\\nher swear she\\'d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with\\nthem out of the congested districts board that had pictures cut out of\\npapers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do\\nsomething not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed. but\\nthis was altogether different from a thing like that because there was\\nall the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to\\nhis and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips. besides there\\nwas absolution so long as you didn\\'t do the other thing before being\\nmarried and there ought to be women priests that would understand\\nwithout your telling out and cissy caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy\\nkind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and winny\\nrippingham so mad about actors\\' photographs and besides it was on\\naccount of that other thing coming on the way it did.\\n\\nand jacky caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back\\nand the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and\\nthey all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and\\nshe leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was\\nflying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. and she saw a\\nlong roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense\\nhush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and\\nhigher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high,\\nhigh, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an\\nentrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things\\ntoo, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than\\nthose other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being\\nwhite and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high\\nit went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from\\nbeing bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee\\nwhere no-one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn\\'t ashamed\\nand he wasn\\'t either to look in that immodest way like that because he\\ncouldn\\'t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like\\nthose skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he\\nkept on looking, looking. she would fain have cried to him chokingly,\\nheld out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on\\nher white brow, the cry of a young girl\\'s love, a little strangled cry,\\nwrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages. and then a\\nrocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and o! then the roman candle\\nburst and it was like a sigh of o! and everyone cried o! o! in raptures\\nand it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they\\nshed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, o so\\nlovely, o, soft, sweet, soft!\\n\\nthen all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. ah! she\\nglanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of\\npiteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl he\\nwas leaning back against the rock behind. leopold bloom (for it is he)\\nstands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes. what a\\nbrute he had been! at it again? a fair unsullied soul had called to him\\nand, wretch that he was, how had he answered? an utter cad he had been!\\nhe of all men! but there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes,\\nfor him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and\\nwandered. should a girl tell? no, a thousand times no. that was their\\nsecret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to\\nknow or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening\\nto and fro and little bats don\\'t tell.\\n\\ncissy caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show\\nwhat a great person she was: and then she cried:\\n\\n--gerty! gerty! we\\'re going. come on. we can see from farther up.\\n\\ngerty had an idea, one of love\\'s little ruses. she slipped a hand into\\nher kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of\\ncourse without letting him and then slipped it back. wonder if he\\'s too\\nfar to. she rose. was it goodbye? no. she had to go but they would meet\\nagain, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her\\ndream of yester eve. she drew herself up to her full height. their souls\\nmet in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full\\nof a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face. she\\nhalf smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged\\non tears, and then they parted.\\n\\nslowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to cissy,\\nto edy to jacky and tommy caffrey, to little baby boardman. it was\\ndarker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and\\nslippy seaweed. she walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic\\nof her but with care and very slowly because--because gerty macdowell\\nwas...\\n\\ntight boots? no. she\\'s lame! o!\\n\\nmr bloom watched her as she limped away. poor girl!

whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed\\nthem a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. and there came\\nagainst the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept dixon. and\\nthe traveller leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they\\nhad had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this\\nlearningknight lay by cause the traveller leopold came there to be\\nhealed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a\\nhorrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make\\na salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice. and he\\nsaid now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with\\nthem that were there. and the traveller leopold said that he should go\\notherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile. also the lady\\nwas of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well\\nthat the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility. but\\nthe learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have\\nhim in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous\\ncastle. and the traveller leopold went into the castle for to rest him\\nfor a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers\\nlands and sometime venery.\\n\\nand in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of finlandy\\nand it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not\\nmove more for enchantment. and on this board were frightful swords and\\nknives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white\\nflames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there\\nabound marvellously. and there were vessels that are wrought by magic of\\nmahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he\\nblases in to them like to bubbles. and full fair cheer and rich was on\\nthe board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer. and there was\\na vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange\\nfishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible\\nthing without they see it natheless they are so. and these fishes lie\\nin an oily water brought there from portugal land because of the fatness\\nthat therein is like to the juices of the olivepress. and also it was\\na marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of\\nfecund wheatkidneys out of chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits\\nthat they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain. and\\nthey teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks\\nout of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a\\nbrewage like to mead.\\n\\nand the learning knight let pour for childe leopold a draught and halp\\nthereto the while all they that were there drank every each. and childe\\nleopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat\\nin amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and\\nanon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and\\nhis neighbour nist not of this wile. and he sat down in that castle with\\nthem for to rest him there awhile. thanked be almighty god.\\n\\nthis meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the\\nreverence of jesu our alther liege lord to leave their wassailing for\\nthere was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied\\nfast. sir leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what\\ncry that it was whether of child or woman and i marvel, said he, that it\\nbe not come or now. meseems it dureth overlong. and he was ware and saw\\na franklin that hight lenehan on that side the table

too she will bring forth by god his\\nbounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long.\\nand the franklin that had drunken said, expecting each moment to be her\\nnext. also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never\\nnone asking nor desiring of him to drink and, now drink, said he, fully\\ndelectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both\\'s health for\\nhe was a passing good man of his lustiness. and sir leopold that was the\\ngoodliest guest that ever sat in scholars\\' hall and that was the meekest\\nman and the kindest that ever laid

wonder\\npondering.\\n\\nnow let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be\\ndrunken an they might. there was a sort of scholars along either side\\nthe board, that is to wit, dixon yclept junior of saint mary merciable\\'s\\nwith other his fellows lynch and madden, scholars of medicine, and the\\nfranklin that hight lenehan and one from alba longa, one crotthers, and\\nyoung stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board\\nand costello that men clepen punch costello all long of a mastery of\\nhim erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young stephen, he was the\\nmost drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir\\nleopold. but on young malachi they waited for that he promised to have\\ncome and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow.\\nand sir leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir simon\\nand to this his son young stephen and for that his languor becalmed him\\nthere after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that\\ntime in the honourablest manner. ruth red him, love led on with will to\\nwander, loth to leave.\\n\\nfor they were right witty scholars. and he heard their aresouns each gen\\nother as touching birth and righteousness, young madden maintaining that\\nput such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a\\nmatter of some year agone with a woman of eblana in horne\\'s house that\\nnow was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her\\ndeath all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case). and\\nthey said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said,\\nthe woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of\\nthis imagination affirmed how young madden had said truth for he had\\nconscience to let her die. and not few and of these was young lynch\\nwere in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never\\nother howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his\\njudges did provide no remedy. a redress god grant. this was scant said\\nbut all cried with one acclaim nay, by our virgin mother, the wife\\nshould live and the babe to die. in colour whereof they waxed hot\\nupon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the\\nfranklin lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the\\nleast way mirth might not lack. then young madden showed all the whole\\naffair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by\\nrede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to saint ultan of\\narbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were\\nall wondrous grieved. to whom young stephen had these words following:\\nmurmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk. both babe and parent now\\nglorify their maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire.\\nbut, gramercy, what of those godpossibled souls that we nightly\\nimpossibilise, which is the sin against the holy ghost, very god, lord\\nand giver of life? for, sirs, he said, our lust is brief. we are means\\nto those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we.\\nthen said dixon junior to punch costello wist he what ends. but he had\\novermuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he\\nwould ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if\\nit so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead. whereat\\ncrotthers of alba longa sang young malachi\\'s praise of that beast the\\nunicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all\\nthis while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice\\nhim, witnessing all and several by saint foutinus his engines that\\nhe was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do. thereat\\nlaughed they all right jocundly only young stephen and sir leopold which\\nnever durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would\\nnot bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might\\nbe or wheresoever. then spake young stephen orgulous of mother church\\nthat would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of lilith,\\npatron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness\\nor by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as virgilius saith, by the\\ninfluence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie\\nwith a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu secuto_, or\\nperadventure in her bath according to the opinions of averroes and moses\\nmaimonides. he said also how at the end of the second month a human soul\\nwas infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for god\\'s\\ngreater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear\\nbeastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman\\'s\\nseal, even that blessed peter on which rock was holy church for all ages\\nfounded. all they bachelors then asked of sir leopold would he in like\\ncase so jeopard her person as risk life to save life. a wariness of\\nmind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said\\ndissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever\\nloved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his\\nexperience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother\\nchurch belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort\\ndeliverly he scaped their questions. that is truth, pardy, said dixon,\\nand, or i err, a pregnant word. which hearing young stephen was a\\nmarvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor\\nlendeth to the lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and\\nthat he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.\\n\\nbut sir leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had\\npity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour\\nand as he was minded of his good lady marion that had borne him an only\\nmanchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art\\ncould save so dark is destiny. and she was wondrous stricken of heart\\nfor that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of\\nlamb\\'s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and\\nlie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir\\nleopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his\\nfriend\\'s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and\\nas sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all\\naccounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure\\nfor young stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and\\nmurdered his goods with whores.\\n\\nabout that present time young stephen filled all cups that stood empty\\nso as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed\\ntheir approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for\\nthe intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the\\nvicar of christ which also as he said is

of\\ntwo pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he\\nwrit. they all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of\\nmoney as was herebefore. his words were then these as

answered him obedience in the\\nwomb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days. master\\nlenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds\\nand how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue\\nof a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all\\nintershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership. but he\\nsaid very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was\\nthe eternal son and ever virgin. thereat mirth grew in them the more and\\nthey rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and\\ndeflowering of spouses, as the priests use in madagascar island, she\\nto be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with\\nburning of nard and tapers, on a

all\\nthe heavens so that master madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked\\nhim on his ribs upon that crack of doom and master bloom, at the\\nbraggart\\'s side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear,\\nadvertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard,\\nthe discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken\\nplace, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon.\\n\\nbut was young boasthard\\'s fear vanquished by calmer\\'s words? no, for he\\nhad in his bosom a spike named bitterness which could not by words be\\ndone away. and was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the\\nother? he was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. but\\ncould he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the\\nbottle holiness that then he lived withal? indeed no for grace was not\\nthere to find that bottle. heard he then in that clap the voice of the\\ngod bringforth or, what calmer said, a hubbub of phenomenon? heard?\\nwhy, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube\\nunderstanding (which he had not done). for through that tube he saw that\\nhe was in the land of phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die\\nas he was like the rest too a passing show. and would he not accept to\\ndie like the rest and pass away? by no means would he though he must nor\\nwould he make more shows according as men do with wives which phenomenon\\nhas commanded them to do by the book law. then wotted he nought of that\\nother land which is called believe-on-me, that is the land of promise\\nwhich behoves to the king delightful and shall be for ever where there\\nis no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall\\ncome as many as believe on it? yes, pious had told him of that land and\\nchaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he\\nfell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she\\nsaid, is bird-in-the-hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true\\npath by her flatteries that she said to him as, ho, you pretty man, turn\\naside hither and i will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so\\nflatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named two-in-the-bush\\nor, by some learned, carnal concupiscence.\\n\\nthis was it what all that company that sat there at commons in manse\\nof mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore\\nbird-in-the-hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a\\nwicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and\\nknow her. for regarding believe-on-me they said it was nought else\\nbut notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first,\\ntwo-in-the-bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and\\nin it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words\\nprinted on them, pickaback and topsyturvy and shameface and cheek by\\njowl and, second, for that foul plague allpox and the monsters they\\ncared not for them for preservative had given them a stout shield of\\noxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from offspring\\nthat was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was\\nnamed killchild. so were they all in their blind fancy, mr cavil and mr\\nsometimes godly, mr ape swillale, mr false franklin, mr dainty dixon,\\nyoung boasthard and mr cautious calmer. wherein, o wretched company,\\nwere ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a\\nvery grievous rage that he would presently lift

persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near\\nby which he did mighty brisk. he was a kind of sport gentleman that\\nwent for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women,\\nhorseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat. to tell the truth he was mean\\nin fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses\\nand low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, paul\\'s men, runners,\\nflatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the\\ngame or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights\\ntill broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose\\ngossip. he took his ordinary at a boilingcook\\'s and if he had but gotten\\ninto him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare\\ntester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue,\\nsome randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother\\'s son of\\nthem would burst their sides. the other, costello that is, hearing this\\ntalk asked was it poetry or a tale. faith, no, he says, frank (that was\\nhis name), \\'tis all about kerry cows that are to be butchered along of\\nthe plague. but they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their\\nbully beef, a pox on it. there\\'s as good fish in this tin as ever came\\nout of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that\\nstood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place\\nwhich was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset.\\n_mort aux vaches_, says frank then in the french language that had been\\nindentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in bordeaux and he\\nspoke french like a gentleman too. from a child this frank had been\\na donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to\\nschool to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at\\nthe university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his\\nteeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the\\nparish beadle than with his volumes. one time he would be a playactor,\\nthen a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit\\nand the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on\\nthe roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire\\'s heir by favour of\\nmoonlight or fecking maids\\' linen or choking chicken behind a hedge. he\\nhad been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked\\npockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint\\nof tears as often as he saw him. what, says mr leopold with his hands\\nacross, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter\\nall? i protest i saw them but this day morning going to the liverpool\\nboats, says he. i can scarce believe \\'tis so bad, says he. and he had\\nexperience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and\\nwether wool, having been some years before actuary for mr joseph cuffe,\\na worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow\\nauctions hard by mr gavin low\\'s yard in prussia street. i question with\\nyou there, says he. more like \\'tis the hoose or the timber tongue. mr\\nstephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and\\nthat he had dispatches from the emperor\\'s chief tailtickler thanking\\nhim for the hospitality, that was sending over doctor rinderpest, the\\nbestquoted cowcatcher in all muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to\\ntake the bull by the horns. come, come, says mr vincent, plain dealing.\\nhe\\'ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a\\nbull that\\'s irish, says he. irish by name and irish by nature, says mr\\nstephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an irish bull in an english\\nchinashop. i conceive you, says mr dixon. it is that same bull that was\\nsent to our island by farmer nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them\\nall, with an emerald ring in his nose. true for you, says mr vincent\\ncross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper\\nand a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. he had horns\\ngalore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of\\nhis nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and\\nrollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.\\nwhat for that, says mr dixon, but before he came over farmer nicholas\\nthat was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who\\nwere no better off than himself. so be off now, says he, and do all my\\ncousin german the lord harry tells you and take a farmer\\'s blessing, and\\nwith that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. but the slap and the\\nblessing stood him friend, says mr vincent, for to make up he taught him\\na trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to\\nthis day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper\\nin his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his\\nlong holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in\\nthe four fields of all ireland. another then put in his word: and they\\ndressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and\\ngirdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him\\nall over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of\\nthe road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market\\nso that he could doss and dung to his heart\\'s content. by this time the\\nfather of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that\\nhe could scarce walk to pasture. to remedy which our cozening dames and\\ndamsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his\\nbelly was full he would rear up on his hind uarters to show their\\nladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls\\' language\\nand they all after him. ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he\\nwould suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself\\n(for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up\\non a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying:\\nby the lord harry, green is the grass that grows on the ground. and,\\nsays mr dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in roscommon or\\nthe wilds of connemara or a husbandman in sligo that was sowing as much\\nas a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he\\'d run amok over half\\nthe countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all\\nby lord harry\\'s orders. there was bad blood between them at first, says\\nmr vincent, and the lord harry called farmer nicholas all the old nicks\\nin the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house\\nand i\\'ll meddle in his matters, says he. i\\'ll make that animal smell\\nhell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me. but\\none evening, says mr dixon, when the lord harry was cleaning his royal\\npelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for\\nhimself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row\\nwith pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull\\nand on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry\\nhe found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous\\nchampion bull of the romans, _bos bovum_, which is good bog latin for\\nboss of the show. after that, says mr vincent, the lord harry put his\\nhead into a cow\\'s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers\\nand pulling it out again told them all his new name. then, with the\\nwater running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had\\nbelonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls\\' language\\nto study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal\\npronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went\\nout for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what\\ntook his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of\\ncotton or a corkfloat. in short, he and the bull of ireland were soon as\\nfast friends as an arse and a shirt. they were, says mr stephen, and\\nthe end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as\\nthe ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded\\nthemselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts\\nerect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three\\nsheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor,\\nported her helm, ran up the jolly roger, gave three times three, let the\\nbullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover\\nthe main of america. which was the occasion, says mr vincent, of the\\ncomposing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty:\\n\\n     _--pope peter\\'s but a pissabed.\\n     a man\\'s a man for a\\' that._\\n\\nour worthy acquaintance mr malachi mulligan now appeared in the doorway\\nas the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend\\nwhom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name alec bannon,\\nwho had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a\\ncornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. mr mulligan was civil\\nenough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a\\nproject of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched\\non. whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards\\nwhich he had had printed that day at mr quinnell\\'s bearing a legend\\nprinted in fair italics: _mr malachi mulligan. fertiliser and incubator.\\nlambay island_. his project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw\\nfrom the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir\\nfopling popinjay and sir milksop quidnunc in town and to devote himself\\nto the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed. well,\\nlet us hear of it, good my friend, said mr dixon. i make no doubt it\\nsmacks of wenching. come, be seated, both. \\'tis as cheap sitting as\\nstanding. mr mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon\\nhis design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by\\na consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the\\nprohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal\\nvexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the\\nprohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities\\nacquired. it grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch\\ndefrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable\\nfemales with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their\\nflambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly\\nbloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might\\nmultiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of\\ntheir sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he\\nassured them, made his heart weep. to curb this inconvenient (which\\nhe concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with\\ncertain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had\\nresolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of lambay\\nisland from its holder, lord talbot de malahide, a tory gentleman of\\nnote much in favour with our ascendancy party. he proposed to set up\\nthere a national fertilising farm to be named _omphalos_ with an obelisk\\nhewn and erected after the fashion of egypt and to offer his dutiful\\nyeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life\\nsoever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the\\nfunctions of her natural. money was no object, he said, nor would he\\ntake a penny for his pains. the poorest kitchenwench no less than the\\nopulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers\\nwere warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man.\\nfor his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a\\ndiet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these\\nlatter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both\\nbroiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum\\nchillies. after this homily which he delivered with much warmth of\\nasseveration mr mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with\\nwhich he had shielded it. they both, it seems, had been overtaken by the\\nrain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be\\nobserved by mr mulligan\\'s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now\\nsomewhat piebald. his project meanwhile was very favourably entertained\\nby his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though mr dixon of\\nmary\\'s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also\\nto carry coals to newcastle. mr mulligan however made court to the\\nscholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt\\nupon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his\\ncontention: _talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, o quirites,\\nut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici\\ntitillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus\\ncenturionum romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder\\nwit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more\\nsuitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the\\nfarmyard drake and duck.\\n\\nvaluing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper\\nman of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with\\nanimadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics\\nwhile the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had\\nadvanced. the young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a\\npassage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his\\nnearest neighbour. mr mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom\\nwere those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him\\na civil bow and said, pray, sir, was you in need of any professional\\nassistance we could give? who, upon his offer, thanked him very\\nheartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was\\ncome there about a lady, now an inmate of horne\\'s house, that was in an\\ninteresting condition, poor body, from woman\\'s woe (and here he fetched\\na deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place. mr dixon,\\nto turn the table, took on to ask of mr mulligan himself whether\\nhis incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an\\novoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due,\\nas with the noted physician, mr austin meldon, to a wolf in the stomach.\\nfor answer mr mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote\\nhimself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll\\nmimic of mother grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though\\n\\'tis pity she\\'s a trollop): there\\'s a belly that never bore a bastard.\\nthis was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw\\nthe whole room into the most violent agitations of delight. the spry\\nrattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the\\nantechamber.\\n\\nhere the listener who was none other than the scotch student, a little\\nfume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion\\nwith the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient\\npoint, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the\\nobligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by\\na questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had\\nnot achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but\\ncontrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever\\ndone in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. _mais bien sur_,\\nnoble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_. that you may\\nand very opportunely. there wanted nothing but this cup to crown my\\nfelicity. but, gracious heaven, was i left with but a crust in my wallet\\nand a cupful of water from the well, my god, i would accept of them and\\nfind it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to\\nthe powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the giver of good\\nthings. with these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a\\ncomplacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his\\nbosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very\\npicture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.\\ngazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, ah, monsieur, he\\nsaid, had you but beheld her as i did with these eyes at that affecting\\ninstant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her\\nfeastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so\\nmelting a tenderness, \\'pon my conscience, even you, monsieur, had been\\nimpelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of\\nsuch an enemy or to quit the field for ever. i declare, i was never so\\ntouched in all my life. god, i thank thee, as the author of my days!\\nthrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her\\nfavours. a sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having\\nreplaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.\\nbeneficent disseminator of blessings to all thy creatures, how great\\nand universal must be that sweetest of thy tyrannies which can hold in\\nthrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb,\\nthe lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer\\nyears. but indeed, sir, i wander from the point. how mingled and\\nimperfect are all our sublunary joys. maledicity! he exclaimed in\\nanguish. would to god that foresight had but remembered me to take my\\ncloak along! i could weep to think of it. then, though it had poured\\nseven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. but beshrew me,\\nhe cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and,\\nthousand thunders, i know of a _marchand de capotes_, monsieur poyntz,\\nfrom whom i can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the french fashion\\nas ever kept a lady from wetting. tut, tut! cries le fecondateur,\\ntripping in, my friend monsieur moore, that most accomplished traveller\\n(i have just cracked a half bottle avec lui in a circle of the best wits\\nof the town), is my authority that in cape horn, _ventre biche_, they\\nhave a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak. a\\ndrenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans blague_, has sent more\\nthan one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world.\\npooh! a _livre!_ cries monsieur lynch. the clumsy things are dear at a\\nsou. one umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten\\nsuch stopgaps. no woman of any wit would wear one. my dear kitty told me\\ntoday that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in\\nsuch an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and\\nwhispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy\\nbutterflies), dame nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in\\nour hearts and it has become a household word that _il y a deux choses_\\nfor which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a\\nbreach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment. the\\nfirst, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as i handed her to her\\ntilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer\\nchamber of my ear), the first is a bath... but at this point a bell\\ntinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for\\nthe enrichment of our store of knowledge.\\n\\namid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while\\nall were conjecturing what might be the cause, miss callan entered and,\\nhaving spoken a few words in a low tone to young mr dixon, retired with\\na profound bow to the company. the presence even for a moment among a\\nparty of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and\\nnot less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of\\nthe most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of\\nribaldry. strike me silly, said costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.\\na monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! i\\'ll be sworn she has rendezvoused\\nyou. what, you dog? have you a way with them? gad\\'s bud, immensely\\nso, said mr lynch. the bedside manner it is that they use in the mater\\nhospice. demme, does not doctor o\\'gargle chuck the nuns there under the\\nchin. as i look to be saved i had it from my kitty who has been wardmaid\\nthere any time these seven months. lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young\\nblood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest\\nsquirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! drat the man! bless\\nme, i\\'m all of a wibbly wobbly. why, you\\'re as bad as dear little father\\ncantekissem, that you are! may this pot of four half choke me, cried\\ncostello, if she aint in the family way. i knows a lady what\\'s got a\\nwhite swelling quick as i claps eyes on her. the young surgeon, however,\\nrose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just\\nthen informed him that he was needed in the ward. merciful providence\\nhad been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was\\n_enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had\\ngiven birth to a bouncing boy. i want patience, said he, with those\\nwho, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling\\nprofession which, saving the reverence due to the deity, is the greatest\\npower for happiness upon the earth. i am positive when i say that if\\nneed were i could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of\\nher noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a\\nglorious incentive in the human breast. i cannot away with them. what?\\nmalign such an one, the amiable miss callan, who is the lustre of\\nher own sex and the astonishment of ours? and at an instant the most\\nmomentous that can befall a puny child of clay? perish the thought! i\\nshudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice\\nhave been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and\\nmaid in house of horne. having delivered himself of this rebuke he\\nsaluted those present on the by and repaired to the door. a murmur\\nof approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker\\nwithout more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would\\nhe have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his\\ntransgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a\\nround hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew\\nbreath. stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of\\nhonest frank costello which i was bred up most particular to honour thy\\nfather and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty\\npudding as you ever see what i always looks back on with a loving heart.\\n\\nto revert to mr bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of\\nsome impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits\\nof that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not\\npity. the young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies\\nas overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions\\nwere difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and\\noutrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were\\nthey scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of\\nstrong animal spirits spoke in their behalf. but the word of mr costello\\nwas an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that\\nseemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out\\nof wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the\\nworld, which the dint of the surgeon\\'s pliers in his skull lent indeed\\na colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of\\ncreation\\'s chain desiderated by the late ingenious mr darwin. it was now\\nfor more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed\\nthrough the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary\\nascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart\\nto repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them\\nwith the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude\\nof sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find\\ntolerable and but tolerable. to those who create themselves wits at the\\ncost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold\\nwith) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit\\nthe tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost\\nall forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of\\nexperience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious\\nretreat. not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring\\nnought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever\\n(as the chaste fancy of the holy writer expresses it) for eating of the\\ntree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any\\ncondition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful\\noccasions. to conclude, while from the sister\\'s words he had reckoned\\nupon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little\\nalleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an\\nordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to\\nthe bounty of the supreme being.\\n\\naccordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express\\nhis notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express\\none) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not\\nto be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement\\nsince she had been in such pain through no fault of hers. the dressy\\nyoung blade said it was her husband\\'s that put her in that expectation\\nor at least it ought to be unless she were another ephesian matron. i\\nmust acquaint you, said mr crotthers, clapping on the table so as to\\nevoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old glory allelujurum was round\\nagain today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his\\nnose a request to have word of wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her. i\\nbade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon.\\n\\'slife, i\\'ll be round with you. i cannot but extol the virile potency of\\nthe old bucko that could still knock another child out of her. all fell\\nto praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young\\nblade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had\\nbeen the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or\\nan itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household. singular,\\ncommuned the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of\\nmetempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the\\ndissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the\\nmere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a\\npinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of\\nan art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest. but,\\nhe further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in\\ncommon oppress them for i have more than once observed that birds of a\\nfeather laugh together.\\n\\nbut with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron,\\nhas this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted\\nto civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our\\ninternal polity? where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have\\ncounselled? during the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary\\nadvantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that\\nmoment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant\\nat will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents? has he\\nforgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? or is it that from\\nbeing a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is,\\nif report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer? far be it from\\ncandour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of\\na gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her\\nvirtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his\\ninterest not to have done) then be it so. unhappy woman, she has been\\ntoo long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to\\nlisten to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of\\nthe desperate. he says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his\\npiety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt\\nillicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata\\nof society! nay, had the hussy\\'s scouringbrush not been her tutelary\\nangel, it had gone with her as hard as with hagar, the egyptian! in the\\nquestion of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in\\nmr cuffe\\'s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing\\nretort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic. it ill\\nbecomes him to preach that gospel. has he not nearer home a seedfield\\nthat lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare? a habit reprehensible\\nat puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life. if he must\\ndispense his balm of gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste\\nto restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his\\npractice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him. his\\nmarital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant\\nto adduce. the lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for\\na consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and\\nhealer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in\\nits native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm\\nbut, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their\\nquondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid\\nand inoperative.\\n\\nthe news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial\\nusage of the sublime porte by the second female infirmarian to the\\njunior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the\\ndelegation that an heir had been born, when he had betaken himself\\nto the women\\'s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the\\nafterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic\\naffairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous\\nexhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and\\nsolemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would\\npalliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and\\nobstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of\\ntongues. in vain the voice of mr canvasser bloom was heard endeavouring\\nto urge, to mollify, to refrain. the moment was too propitious for the\\ndisplay of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among\\ntempers so divergent. every phase of the situation was successively\\neviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the caesarean\\nsection, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form,\\nwith respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the childs\\nmurder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of mr advocate\\nbushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the\\nrights of primogeniture and king\\'s bounty touching twins and triplets,\\nmiscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac\\n_foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia\\nof certain chinless chinamen (cited by mr candidate mulligan) in\\nconsequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial\\nline so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the\\nbenefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour\\npains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the\\npremature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the\\nactual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial\\ninsemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent\\nupon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in\\nthe case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing\\nmanner of delivery called by the brandenburghers _sturzgeburt,_ the\\nrecorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births\\nconceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents--in\\na word all the cases of human nativity which aristotle has classified\\nin his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations. the gravest\\nproblems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much\\nanimation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as\\nthe forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest,\\nby her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and\\nthe injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and\\nineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her\\nperson which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation.\\nthe abnormalities of harelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits, negro\\'s\\ninkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a\\n_prima facie_ and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded\\n(the case of madame grissel steevens was not forgotten) or doghaired\\ninfants occasionally born. the hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced\\nby the caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of\\nthe land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic\\ndevelopment at some stage antecedent to the human. an outlandish\\ndelegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost\\ncarried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males\\nof brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables\\nsuch as that of the minotaur which the genius of the elegant latin poet\\nhas handed down to us in the pages of his metamorphoses. the impression\\nmade by his words was immediate but shortlived. it was effaced as easily\\nas it had been evoked by an allocution from mr candidate mulligan in\\nthat vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect,\\npostulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man.\\ncontemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between mr delegate\\nmadden and mr candidate lynch regarding the juridical and theological\\ndilemma created in the event of one siamese twin predeceasing the other,\\nthe difficulty by mutual consent was referred to mr canvasser bloom\\nfor instant submittal to mr coadjutor deacon dedalus. hitherto silent,\\nwhether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity\\nof the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward\\nvoice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the\\necclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what god has\\njoined.\\n\\nbut malachias\\' tale began to freeze them with horror. he conjured up the\\nscene before them. the secret panel beside the chimney slid back and\\nin the recess appeared... haines! which of us did not feel his flesh\\ncreep! he had a portfolio full of celtic literature in one hand, in the\\nother a phial marked _poison._ surprise, horror, loathing were depicted\\non all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin. i anticipated some\\nsuch reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems,\\nhistory is to blame. yes, it is true. i am the murderer of samuel\\nchilds. and how i am punished! the inferno has no terrors for me. this\\nis the appearance is on me. tare and ages, what way would i be resting\\nat all, he muttered thickly, and i tramping dublin this while back\\nwith my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a\\nbullawurrus? my hell, and ireland\\'s, is in this life. it is what i tried\\nto obliterate my crime. distractions, rookshooting, the erse language\\n(he recited some), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping\\nout. in vain! his spectre stalks me. dope is my only hope... ah!\\ndestruction! the black panther! with a cry he suddenly vanished and the\\npanel slid back. an instant later his head appeared in the door opposite\\nand said: meet me at westland row station at ten past eleven. he was\\ngone. tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host. the seer\\nraised his hand to heaven, murmuring: the vendetta of mananaun! the\\nsage repeated: _lex talionis_. the sentimentalist is he who would enjoy\\nwithout incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done. malachias,\\novercome by emotion, ceased. the mystery was unveiled. haines was the\\nthird brother. his real name was childs. the black panther was himself\\nthe ghost of his own father. he drank drugs to obliterate. for this\\nrelief much thanks. the lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited.\\nno soul will live there. the spider pitches her web in the solitude.\\nthe nocturnal rat peers from his hole. a curse is on it. it is haunted.\\nmurderer\\'s ground.\\n\\nwhat is the age of the soul of man? as she hath the virtue of the\\nchameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the\\nmerry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as\\nher mood. no longer is leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing\\nthe cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a\\nmodest substance in the funds. a score of years are blown away. he is\\nyoung leopold. there, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within\\na mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself. that young figure of then\\nis seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old\\nhouse in clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on\\nhim bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother\\'s\\nthought. or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first\\nhard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged\\ntraveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented\\nhandkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas!\\na thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this\\nor that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for\\na budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart? tell me!) his\\nstudied baisemoins. the scent, the smile, but, more than these, the dark\\neyes and oleaginous address, brought home at duskfall many a commission\\nto the head of the firm, seated with jacob\\'s pipe after like labours in\\nthe paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you may be sure, is aheating),\\nreading through round horned spectacles some paper from the europe of a\\nmonth before. but hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young\\nknighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the\\nmist. now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his\\nsons. who can say? the wise father knows his own child. he thinks of a\\ndrizzling night in hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the\\nfirst. together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine\\nand of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear\\nthe heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal\\nuniversity. bridie! bridie kelly! he will never forget the name, ever\\nremember the night: first night, the bridenight. they are entwined\\nin nethermost darkness, the willer with the willed, and in an instant\\n(_fiat_!) light shall flood the world. did heart leap to heart? nay,\\nfair reader. in a breath \\'twas done but--hold! back! it must not be! in\\nterror the poor girl flees away through the murk. she is the bride of\\ndarkness, a daughter of night. she dare not bear the sunnygolden babe\\nof day. no, leopold. name and memory solace thee not. that youthful\\nillusion of thy strength was taken from thee--and in vain. no son of thy\\nloins is by thee. there is none now to be for leopold, what leopold was\\nfor rudolph.\\n\\nthe voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the\\ninfinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions\\nof cycles of generations that have lived. a region where grey twilight\\never descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her\\ndusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars. she follows her mother with\\nungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal. twilight phantoms\\nare they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely\\nhaunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull. they\\nfade, sad phantoms: all is gone. agendath is a waste land, a home of\\nscreechowls and the sandblind upupa. netaim, the golden, is no more. and\\non the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion,\\nthe ghosts of beasts. huuh! hark! huuh! parallax stalks behind and goads\\nthem, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions. elk and\\nyak, the bulls of bashan and of babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come\\ntrooping to the sunken sea, _lacus mortis_. ominous revengeful zodiacal\\nhost! they moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the\\ntrumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter\\nand crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning\\nmultitude, murderers of the sun.\\n\\nonward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible\\ngulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood. and the equine portent\\ngrows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven\\'s own\\nmagnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of virgo. and lo, wonder\\nof metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the\\ndaystar, the bride, ever virgin. it is she, martha, thou lost one,\\nmillicent, the young, the dear, the radiant. how serene does she now\\narise, a queen among the pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour,\\nshod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call\\nit gossamer. it floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it\\nstreams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents\\nof the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling,\\nwrithing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad\\nmetamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, alpha, a ruby and triangled sign\\nupon the forehead of taurus.\\n\\nfrancis was reminding stephen of years before when they had been at\\nschool together in conmee\\'s time. he asked about glaucon, alcibiades,\\npisistratus. where were they now? neither knew. you have spoken of the\\npast and its phantoms, stephen said. why think of them? if i call them\\ninto life across the waters of lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to\\nmy call? who supposes it? i, bous stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending\\nbard, am lord and giver of their life. he encircled his gadding hair\\nwith a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at vincent. that answer and those\\nleaves, vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something\\nmore, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius\\nfather. all who wish you well hope this for you. all desire to see\\nyou bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you stephaneforos. i\\nheartily wish you may not fail them. o no, vincent lenehan said, laying\\na hand on the shoulder near him. have no fear. he could not leave his\\nmother an orphan. the young man\\'s face grew dark. all could see how hard\\nit was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss. he\\nwould have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed\\nthe smart. madden had lost five drachmas on sceptre for a whim of the\\nrider\\'s name: lenehan as much more. he told them of the race. the flag\\nfell and, huuh! off, scamper, the mare ran out freshly with 0. madden\\nup. she was leading the field. all hearts were beating. even phyllis\\ncould not contain herself. she waved her scarf and cried: huzzah!\\nsceptre wins! but in the straight on the run home when all were in close\\norder the dark horse throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her. all\\nwas lost now. phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones. juno, she\\ncried, i am undone. but her lover consoled her and brought her a bright\\ncasket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook. a\\ntear fell: one only. a whacking fine whip, said lenehan, is w. lane.\\nfour winners yesterday and three today. what rider is like him? mount\\nhim on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter\\nis still his. but let us bear it as was the ancient wont. mercy on the\\nluckless! poor sceptre! he said with a light sigh. she is not the filly\\nthat she was. never, by this hand, shall we behold such another. by gad,\\nsir, a queen of them. do you remember her, vincent? i wish you could\\nhave seen my queen today, vincent said. how young she was and radiant\\n(lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of\\nmuslin, i do not know the right name of it. the chestnuts that shaded\\nus were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with\\npollen floating by us. in the sunny patches one might easily have\\ncooked on a stone a batch of those buns with corinth fruit in them that\\nperiplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge. but she had nought\\nfor her teeth but the arm with which i held her and in that she nibbled\\nmischievously when i pressed too close. a week ago she lay ill, four\\ndays on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril.\\nshe is more taking then. her posies tool mad romp that she is, she had\\npulled her fill as we reclined together. and in your ear, my friend, you\\nwill not think who met us as we left the field. conmee himself! he was\\nwalking by the hedge, reading, i think a brevier book with, i doubt not,\\na witty letter in it from glycera or chloe to keep the page. the sweet\\ncreature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a\\nslight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the\\nvery trees adore her. when conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely\\necho in that little mirror she carries. but he had been kind. in going\\nby he had blessed us. the gods too are ever kind, lenehan said. if i had\\npoor luck with bass\\'s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more\\npropensely. he was laying his hand upon a winejar: malachi saw it and\\nwithheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.\\nwarily, malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. his soul is far\\naway. it is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be\\nborn. any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the\\nincorruptible eon of the gods. do you not think it, stephen? theosophos\\ntold me so, stephen answered, whom in a previous existence egyptian\\npriests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law. the lords of the\\nmoon, theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet alpha\\nof the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these\\nwere therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second\\nconstellation.\\n\\nhowever, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him\\nbeing in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which\\nwas entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was\\nnot the case at all. the individual whose visual organs while the above\\nwas going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of\\nanimation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody\\nthat conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty\\nspeedily in the wrong shop. during the past four minutes or thereabouts\\nhe had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one bass bottled\\nby messrs bass and co at burton-on-trent which happened to be situated\\namongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was\\ncertainly calculated to attract anyone\\'s remark on account of its\\nscarlet appearance. he was simply and solely, as it subsequently\\ntranspired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an\\naltogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment\\nbefore\\'s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two\\nor three private transactions of his own which the other two were as\\nmutually innocent of as the babe unborn. eventually, however, both\\ntheir eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was\\nendeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined\\nto help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the\\nmediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and\\nmade a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the\\nsame time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not\\nto upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.\\n\\nthe debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the\\ncourse of life. neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. the\\ndebaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on\\nthe loftiest and most vital. the high hall of horne\\'s house had never\\nbeheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the\\nold rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so\\nencyclopaedic. a gallant scene in truth it made. crotthers was there at\\nthe foot of the table in his striking highland garb, his face glowing\\nfrom the briny airs of the mull of galloway. there too, opposite to him,\\nwas lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity\\nand premature wisdom. next the scotchman was the place assigned to\\ncostello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose\\nthe squat form of madden. the chair of the resident indeed stood vacant\\nbefore the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of bannon in\\nexplorer\\'s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted\\nsharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of malachi\\nroland st john mulligan. lastly at the head of the board was the young\\npoet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical\\ninquisition in the convivial atmosphere of socratic discussion, while\\nto right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator,\\nfresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the\\ndust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible\\ndishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril\\nor threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous\\nloveliness which the inspired pencil of lafayette has limned for ages\\nyet to come.\\n\\nit had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted\\ntranscendentalism to which mr s. dedalus\\' (div. scep.) contentions\\nwould appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to\\naccepted scientific methods. science, it cannot be too often repeated,\\ndeals with tangible phenomena. the man of science like the man in the\\nstreet has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain\\nthem as best he can. there may be, it is true, some questions which\\nscience cannot answer--at present--such as the first problem submitted\\nby mr l. bloom (pubb. canv.) regarding the future determination of sex.\\nmust we accept the view of empedocles of trinacria that the right ovary\\n(the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth\\nof males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the\\ndifferentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to\\nopine, such as culpepper, spallanzani, blumenbach, lusk, hertwig,\\nleopold and valenti, a mixture of both? this would be tantamount to\\na cooperation (one of nature\\'s favourite devices) between the _nisus\\nformativus_ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily\\nchosen position, _succubitus felix_ of the passive element. the other\\nproblem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant\\nmortality. it is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we\\nare all born in the same way but we all die in different ways. mr m.\\nmulligan (hyg. et eug. doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which\\nour greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. by\\ninhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust. these factors, he alleged,\\nand the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity\\nposters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers\\nand sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of\\ndead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas--these, he\\nsaid, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of\\nthe race. kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted\\nand all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature,\\nlight philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of\\nthe classical statues such as venus and apollo, artistic coloured\\nphotographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable\\nladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months\\nin a most enjoyable manner. mr j. crotthers (disc. bacc.) attributes\\nsome of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers\\nsubjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in\\nthe home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official,\\nculminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal\\nabortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide. although the former\\n(we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he\\ncites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity\\nis too rare to be normative. in fact when one comes to look into it the\\nwonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they\\ndo, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which\\noften baulk nature in her intentions. an ingenious suggestion is\\nthat thrown out by mr v. lynch (bacc. arith.) that both natality and\\nmortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements,\\nlunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in\\nfine, in nature\\'s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun\\nto the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our\\npublic parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained.\\nstill the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy\\nparents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs\\nunaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same\\nmarriage do not) must certainly, in the poet\\'s words, give us pause.\\nnature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for\\nwhatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law\\nof anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken\\nup their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the\\nplasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an\\nincreasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though\\nproductive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is\\nnevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the\\nrace in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest. mr s.\\ndedalus\\' (div. scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?)\\nthat an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and\\napparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect\\nimperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females\\nemaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak\\nof jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric\\nrelief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought\\nelse could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to.\\nfor the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with\\nthe minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and\\nembryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things\\nscientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides\\nhimself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in\\nthe vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the\\ncookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother. in\\na recent public controversy with mr l. bloom (pubb. canv.) which took\\nplace in the commons\\' hall of the national maternity hospital, 29, 30\\nand 31 holles street, of which, as is well known, dr a. horne (lic. in\\nmidw., f. k. q. c. p. i.) is the able and popular master, he is reported\\nby eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat\\ninto the bag (an esthete\\'s allusion, presumably, to one of the most\\ncomplicated and marvellous of all nature\\'s processes--the act of sexual\\ncongress) she must let it out again or give it life, as he phrased it,\\nto save her own. at the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of\\nhis interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured\\ntone in which it was delivered.\\n\\nmeanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a\\nhappy _accouchement._ it had been a weary weary while both for patient\\nand doctor. all that surgical skill could do was done and the brave\\nwoman had manfully helped. she had. she had fought the good fight and\\nnow she was very very happy. those who have passed on, who have gone\\nbefore, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching\\nscene. reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight\\nin her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is\\nto see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent\\nprayer of thanksgiving to one above, the universal husband. and as her\\nloving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have\\nher dear doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that\\nmite of god\\'s clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces. he is older now\\n(you and i may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet\\nin the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious\\nsecond accountant of the ulster bank, college green branch. o doady,\\nloved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that\\nfaroff time of the roses! with the old shake of her pretty head she\\nrecalls those days. god! how beautiful now across the mist of years! but\\ntheir children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers\\nand his, charley, mary alice, frederick albert (if he had lived), mamy,\\nbudgy (victoria frances), tom, violet constance louisa, darling little\\nbobsy (called after our famous hero of the south african war, lord bobs\\nof waterford and candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a\\npurefoy if ever there was one, with the true purefoy nose. young hopeful\\nwill be christened mortimer edward after the influential third cousin of\\nmr purefoy in the treasury remembrancer\\'s office, dublin castle. and so\\ntime wags on: but father cronion has dealt lightly here. no, let no sigh\\nbreak from that bosom, dear gentle mina. and doady, knock the ashes from\\nyour pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for\\nyou (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read\\nin the sacred book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil\\nheart to bed, to rest. he knows and will call in his own good time. you\\ntoo have fought the good fight and played loyally your man\\'s part. sir,\\nto you my hand. well done, thou good and faithful servant!\\n\\nthere are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil\\nmemories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart\\nbut they abide there and wait. he may suffer their memory to grow dim,\\nlet them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself\\nthat they were not or at least were otherwise. yet a chance word will\\ncall them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the\\nmost various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel\\nand harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the\\nevening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine.\\nnot to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under\\nher wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded\\nin the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful.\\n\\nthe stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of\\nthat false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied\\ntrick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an\\nunhealthiness, a _flair,_ for the cruder things of life. a scene\\ndisengages itself in the observer\\'s memory, evoked, it would seem, by\\na word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present\\nthere (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures. a shaven space\\nof lawn one soft may evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at\\nroundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but\\nwith much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over\\nthe sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert\\nshock. and yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times\\nin thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, floey,\\natty, tiny and their darker friend with i know not what of arresting in\\nher pose then, our lady of the cherries, a comely brace of them pendent\\nfrom an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily\\nagainst the cool ardent fruit. a lad of four or five in linseywoolsey\\n(blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long\\nthe bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by\\nthat circle of girlish fond hands. he frowns a little just as this young\\nman does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but\\nmust needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the\\npiazzetta giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness\\nor of reproach (_alles vergangliche_) in her glad look.\\n\\nmark this farther and remember. the end comes suddenly. enter that\\nantechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their\\nfaces. nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent. quietude of\\ncustody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant\\nwatch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in bethlehem of juda long\\nago. but as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with\\npreponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended,\\ncompass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched field\\nand drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an\\ninstant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the\\nthunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was the\\ntransformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the\\nword.\\n\\nburke\\'s! outflings my lord stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and\\nbobtail of all them after, cockerel,

--\\n\\npreparatory to anything else mr bloom brushed off the greater bulk of\\nthe shavings and handed stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up\\ngenerally in orthodox samaritan fashion which he very badly needed. his\\n(stephen\\'s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit\\nunsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink mr\\nbloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of vartry water\\navailable for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an\\nexpedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman\\'s\\nshelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near butt bridge\\nwhere they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and\\nsoda or a mineral. but how to get there was the rub. for the nonce he\\nwas rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him\\nto take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means\\nduring which stephen repeatedly yawned. so far as he could see he was\\nrather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable\\nto get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their\\nthen condition, both of them being e.d.ed, particularly stephen, always\\nassuming that there was such a thing to be found. accordingly after a\\nfew such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten\\nto take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman\\nservice in the shaving line, they both walked together along beaver\\nstreet or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier\\'s and the\\ndistinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of\\nmontgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence\\ndebouching into amiens street round by the corner of dan bergin\\'s. but\\nas he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a jehu plying for\\nhire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some\\nfellows inside on the spree, outside the north star hotel and there was\\nno symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when mr bloom, who was\\nanything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting\\na kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.\\n\\nthis was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently\\nthere was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it\\nwhich they accordingly did. so, bevelling around by mullett\\'s and the\\nsignal house which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the\\ndirection of amiens street railway terminus, mr bloom being handicapped\\nby the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had,\\nto vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though,\\nentering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made\\nlight of the mischance. so as neither of them were particularly pressed\\nfor time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it\\ncleared up after the recent visitation of jupiter pluvius, they dandered\\nalong past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a\\njarvey. as it so happened a dublin united tramways company\\'s sandstrewer\\nhappened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion _a\\npropos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little\\nwhile back. they passed the main entrance of the great northern railway\\nstation, the starting point for belfast, where of course all traffic was\\nsuspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue\\n(a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more\\nespecially at night) ultimately gained the dock tavern and in due course\\nturned into store street, famous for its c division police station.\\nbetween this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of beresford\\nplace stephen thought to think of ibsen, associated with baird\\'s the\\nstonecutter\\'s in his mind somehow in talbot place, first turning on the\\nright, while the other who was acting as his _fidus achates_ inhaled\\nwith internal satisfaction the smell of james rourke\\'s city bakery,\\nsituated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed\\nof our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and\\nmost indispensable. bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, o tell me\\nwhere is fancy bread, at rourke\\'s the baker\\'s it is said.\\n\\n_en route_ to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not\\nyet perfectly sober companion mr bloom who at all events was in complete\\npossession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober,\\nspoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame\\nand swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not\\nas a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for\\nyoung fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking\\nhabits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu\\nfor every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could\\nadminister a nasty kick if you didn\\'t look out. highly providential\\nwas the appearance on the scene of corny kelleher when stephen was\\nblissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the\\neleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a\\ncandidate for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and\\nan appearance in the court next day before mr tobias or, he being the\\nsolicitor rather, old wall, he meant to say, or mahony which simply\\nspelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about. the reason he mentioned\\nthe fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked,\\nwere admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the crown and, as mr\\nbloom put it, recalling a case or two in the a division in clanbrassil\\nstreet, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot. never on\\nthe spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, pembroke road for\\nexample, the\\n\\nguardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being\\nthey were paid to protect the upper classes. another thing he commented\\non was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description\\nliable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them\\nagainst civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything. you\\nfrittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and\\nalso character besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women\\nof the _demimonde_ ran away with a lot of l s. d. into the bargain and\\nthe greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching\\nthe much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old\\nwine in season as both\\n\\nnourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a\\ngood burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond\\na certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to\\ntrouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of\\nothers practically. most of all he commented adversely on the desertion\\nof stephen by all his pubhunting _confreres_ but one, a most glaring\\npiece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.\\n\\n--and that one was judas, stephen said, who up to then had said nothing\\nwhatsoever of any kind.\\n\\ndiscussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back\\nof the customhouse and passed under the loop line bridge where a brazier\\nof coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted\\ntheir rather lagging footsteps. stephen of his own accord stopped for\\nno special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by\\nthe light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker\\nfigure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. he\\nbegan to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having\\nhappened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered\\nthat he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father\\'s,\\ngumley. to avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway\\nbridge.\\n\\n--someone saluted you, mr bloom said.\\n\\na figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches\\nsaluted again, calling:\\n\\n--_night!_\\n\\nstephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the\\ncompliment. mr bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch\\nas he always believed in minding his own business moved off but\\nnevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety\\nthough not funkyish in the least. though unusual in the dublin area he\\nknew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next\\nto nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising\\npeaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some\\nsecluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the\\nthames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply\\nmarauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell\\nswoop at a moment\\'s notice, your money or your life, leaving you there\\nto point a moral, gagged and garrotted.\\n\\nstephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters,\\nthough he was not in an over sober state himself recognised corley\\'s\\nbreath redolent of rotten cornjuice. lord john corley some called him\\nand his genealogy came about in this wise. he was the eldest son of\\ninspector corley of the g division, lately deceased, who had married\\na certain katherine brophy, the daughter of a louth farmer. his\\ngrandfather patrick michael corley of new ross had married the widow\\nof a publican there whose maiden name had been katherine (also) talbot.\\nrumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of\\nthe lords talbot de malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably\\nfine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or\\nsome relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed\\nthe distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. this therefore\\nwas the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute\\nman who now addressed stephen was spoken of by some with facetious\\nproclivities as lord john corley.\\n\\ntaking stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.\\nnot as much as a farthing to purchase a night\\'s lodgings. his friends\\nhad all deserted him. furthermore he had a row with lenehan and called\\nhim to stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other\\nuncalledfor expressions. he was out of a job and implored of stephen to\\ntell him where on god\\'s earth he could get something, anything at all,\\nto do. no, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that\\nwas fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected\\nthrough the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same\\ntime if the whole thing wasn\\'t a complete fabrication from start to\\nfinish. anyhow he was all in.\\n\\n--i wouldn\\'t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and god knows\\ni\\'m on the rocks.\\n\\n--there\\'ll be a job tomorrow or next day, stephen told him, in a boys\\'\\nschool at dalkey for a gentleman usher. mr garrett deasy. try it. you\\nmay mention my name.\\n\\n--ah, god, corley replied, sure i couldn\\'t teach in a school, man. i was\\nnever one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. i got stuck\\ntwice in the junior at the christian brothers.\\n\\n--i have no place to sleep myself, stephen informed him.\\n\\ncorley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to\\ndo with stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody\\ntart off the street. there was a dosshouse in marlborough street, mrs\\nmaloney\\'s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but\\nm\\'conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the brazen head over\\nin winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person\\naddressed of friar bacon) for a bob. he was starving too though he\\nhadn\\'t said a word about it.\\n\\nthough this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it\\nstill stephen\\'s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew\\nthat corley\\'s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly\\ndeserving of much credence. however _haud ignarus malorum miseris\\nsuccurrere disco_ etcetera as the latin poet remarks especially as luck\\nwould have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on\\nthe sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though\\na good bit of the wherewithal was demolished. but the cream of the joke\\nwas nothing would get it out of corley\\'s head that he was living in\\naffluence and hadn\\'t a thing to do but hand out the needful. whereas.\\nhe put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food\\nthere but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu\\nso that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but\\nthe result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash\\nmissing. a few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation.\\nhe tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost\\nas well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a\\npleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact. he was altogether too\\nfagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect.\\nabout biscuits he dimly remembered. who now exactly gave them he\\nwondered or where was or did he buy. however in another pocket he came\\nacross what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously however,\\nas it turned out.\\n\\n--those are halfcrowns, man, corley corrected him.\\n\\nand so in point of fact they turned out to be. stephen anyhow lent him\\none of them.\\n\\n--thanks, corley answered, you\\'re a gentleman. i\\'ll pay you back one\\ntime. who\\'s that with you? i saw him a few times in the bleeding horse\\nin camden street with boylan, the billsticker. you might put in a good\\nword for us to get me taken on there. i\\'d carry a sandwichboard only\\nthe girl in the office told me they\\'re full up for the next three weeks,\\nman. god, you\\'ve to book ahead, man, you\\'d think it was for the carl\\nrosa. i don\\'t give a shite anyway so long as i get a job, even as a\\ncrossing sweeper.\\n\\nsubsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six\\nhe got he informed stephen about a fellow by the name of bags comisky\\nthat he said stephen knew well out of fullam\\'s, the shipchandler\\'s,\\nbookkeeper there that used to be often round in nagle\\'s back with o\\'mara\\nand a little chap with a stutter the name of tighe. anyhow he was lagged\\nthe night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and\\nrefusing to go with the constable.\\n\\n210\\n\\nmr bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the\\ncobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation\\nwatchman\\'s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him,\\nwas having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own\\nprivate account while dublin slept. he threw an odd eye at the same time\\nnow and then at stephen\\'s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor\\nas if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was\\nnot in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when.\\nbeing a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in\\npoint of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated\\nhat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic\\nimpecuniosity. palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the\\nmatter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor\\nneighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for\\nthe matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock\\nhimself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be\\na very rara avis altogether. in any case he had a consummate amount of\\ncool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning.\\npretty thick that was certainly.\\n\\nthe pair parted company and stephen rejoined mr bloom who, with his\\npractised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the\\nblandiloquence of the other parasite. alluding to the encounter he said,\\nlaughingly, stephen, that is:\\n\\n--he is down on his luck. he asked me to ask you to ask somebody named\\nboylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.\\n\\nat this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, mr\\nbloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the\\ndirection of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of eblana,\\nmoored alongside customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair,\\nwhereupon he observed evasively:\\n\\n--everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. now you mention it\\nhis face was familiar to me. but, leaving that for the moment, how much\\ndid you part with, he queried, if i am not too inquisitive?\\n\\n--half a crown, stephen responded. i daresay he needs it to sleep\\nsomewhere.\\n\\n--needs! mr bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at\\nthe intelligence, i can quite credit the assertion and i guarantee he\\ninvariably does. everyone according to his needs or everyone according\\nto his deeds. but, talking about things in general, where, added he with\\na smile, will you sleep yourself? walking to sandycove is out of\\nthe question. and even supposing you did you won\\'t get in after what\\noccurred at westland row station. simply fag out there for nothing. i\\ndon\\'t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why\\ndid you leave your father\\'s house?\\n\\n--to seek misfortune, was stephen\\'s answer.\\n\\n--i met your respected father on a recent occasion, mr bloom\\ndiplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on\\nyesterday. where does he live at present? i gathered in the course of\\nconversation that he had moved.\\n\\n--i believe he is in dublin somewhere, stephen answered unconcernedly.\\nwhy?\\n\\n--a gifted man, mr bloom said of mr dedalus senior, in more respects\\nthan one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one. he takes great\\npride, quite legitimate, out of you. you could go back perhaps, he\\nhasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at westland row\\nterminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, mulligan,\\nthat is, and that english tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred\\ntheir third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally\\nstation belonged to them to give stephen the slip in the confusion,\\nwhich they did.\\n\\nthere was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it\\nwas, stephen\\'s mind\\'s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his\\nfamily hearth the last time he saw it with his sister dilly sitting by\\nthe ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak trinidad shell\\ncocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he\\ncould drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the friday herrings\\nthey had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for maggy, boody and\\nkatey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells\\nand charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in\\naccordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain\\non the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or\\nsomething like that.\\n\\n--no, mr bloom repeated again, i wouldn\\'t personally repose much trust\\nin that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, dr\\nmulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if i were in your shoes. he\\nknows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he\\nnever realised what it is to be without regular meals. of course you\\ndidn\\'t notice as much as i did. but it wouldn\\'t occasion me the least\\nsurprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in\\nyour drink for some ulterior object.\\n\\nhe understood however from all he heard that dr mulligan was a versatile\\nallround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly\\ncoming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade\\nfair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as\\na tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services\\nin addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from\\ncertain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first\\naid at skerries, or malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an\\nexceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that\\nfrankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be\\nat the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy,\\npure and simple.\\n\\n--except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking\\nyour brains, he ventured to throw out.\\n\\nthe guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by\\nfriendliness which he gave at stephen\\'s at present morose expression\\nof features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the\\nproblem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by\\ntwo or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw\\nthrough the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself\\nallowed matters to more or less. grinding poverty did have that effect\\nand he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he\\npossessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.\\n\\nadjacent to the men\\'s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round\\nwhich a group of presumably italians in heated altercation were getting\\nrid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly\\nanimated way, there being some little differences between the parties.\\n\\n--_puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! ho ragione? culo rotto!_\\n\\n_--intendiamoci. mezzo sovrano piu..._\\n\\n_--dice lui, pero!_\\n\\n_--mezzo._\\n\\n_--farabutto! mortacci sui!_\\n\\n_--ma ascolta! cinque la testa piu..._\\n\\nmr bloom and stephen entered the cabman\\'s shelter, an unpretentious\\nwooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been\\nbefore, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few\\nhints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous skin-the-goat\\nfitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual\\nfacts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. a few\\nmoments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner\\nonly to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection\\nof waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus _homo_\\nalready there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation\\nfor whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.\\n\\n--now touching a cup of coffee, mr bloom ventured to plausibly suggest\\nto break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the\\nshape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.\\n\\naccordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order\\nthese commodities quietly. the _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores\\nor whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes\\napparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual\\nportion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for\\nsome appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the\\nfloor. mr bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having\\njust a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be\\nsure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his _protege_ in\\nan audible tone of voice _a propos_ of the battle royal in the street\\nwhich was still raging fast and furious:\\n\\n--a beautiful language. i mean for singing purposes. why do you not\\nwrite your poetry in that language? _bella poetria_! it is so melodious\\nand full. _belladonna. voglio._\\n\\nstephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering\\nfrom lassitude generally, replied:\\n\\n--to fill the ear of a cow elephant. they were haggling over money.\\n\\n--is that so? mr bloom asked. of course, he subjoined pensively, at the\\ninward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were\\nabsolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds\\nit.\\n\\nthe keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tete-a-tete_ put a\\nboiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table\\nand a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed. after\\nwhich he beat a retreat to his counter, mr bloom determining to have\\na good square look at him later on so as not to appear to. for which\\nreason he encouraged stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did\\nthe honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily\\nsupposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.\\n\\n--sounds are impostures, stephen said after a pause of some little time,\\nlike names. cicero, podmore. napoleon, mr goodbody. jesus, mr doyle.\\nshakespeares were as common as murphies. what\\'s in a name?\\n\\n--yes, to be sure, mr bloom unaffectedly concurred. of course. our name\\nwas changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.\\n\\nthe redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded\\nstephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely\\nby asking:\\n\\n--and what might your name be?\\n\\njust in the nick of time mr bloom touched his companion\\'s boot but\\nstephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected\\nquarter, answered:\\n\\n--dedalus.\\n\\nthe sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes,\\nrather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old\\nhollands and water.\\n\\n--you know simon dedalus? he asked at length.\\n\\n--i\\'ve heard of him, stephen said.\\n\\nmr bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently\\neavesdropping too.\\n\\n--he\\'s irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same\\nway and nodding. all irish.\\n\\n--all too irish, stephen rejoined.\\n\\nas for mr bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business\\nand he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor\\nof his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the\\nremark:\\n\\n--i seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his\\nshoulder. the lefthand dead shot.\\n\\nthough he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his\\ngestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.\\n\\n--bottles out there, say. fifty yards measured. eggs on the bottles.\\ncocks his gun over his shoulder. aims.\\n\\nhe turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely. then he\\nscrewed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night\\nwith an unprepossessing cast of countenance.\\n\\n--pom! he then shouted once.\\n\\nthe entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there\\nbeing still a further egg.\\n\\n--pom! he shouted twice.\\n\\negg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding\\nbloodthirstily:\\n\\n_--buffalo bill shoots to kill, never missed nor he never will._\\n\\na silence ensued till mr bloom for agreeableness\\' sake just felt like\\nasking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the\\nbisley.\\n\\n--beg pardon, the sailor said.\\n\\n--long ago? mr bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.\\n\\n--why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic\\ninfluence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. he\\ntoured the wide world with hengler\\'s royal circus. i seen him do that in\\nstockholm.\\n\\n--curious coincidence, mr bloom confided to stephen unobtrusively.\\n\\n--murphy\\'s my name, the sailor continued. d. b. murphy of carrigaloe.\\nknow where that is?\\n\\n--queenstown harbour, stephen replied.\\n\\n--that\\'s right, the sailor said. fort camden and fort carlisle. that\\'s\\nwhere i hails from. i belongs there. that\\'s where i hails from. my\\nlittle woman\\'s down there. she\\'s waiting for me, i know. _for england,\\nhome and beauty_. she\\'s my own true wife i haven\\'t seen for seven years\\nnow, sailing about.\\n\\nmr bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming\\nto the mariner\\'s roadside shieling after having diddled davy jones,\\na rainy night with a blind moon. across the world for a wife. quite a\\nnumber of stories there were on that particular alice ben bolt topic,\\nenoch arden and rip van winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember caoc\\no\\'leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of\\npoor john casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way.\\nnever about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the\\nabsentee. the face at the window! judge of his astonishment when he\\nfinally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent\\nhis better half, wrecked in his affections. you little expected me but\\ni\\'ve come to stay and make a fresh start. there she sits, a grasswidow,\\nat the selfsame fireside. believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the\\ndeep. and there sits uncle chubb or tomkin, as the case might be, the\\npublican of the crown and anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and\\nonions. no chair for father. broo! the wind! her brandnew arrival is on\\nher knee, _post mortem_ child. with a high ro! and a randy ro! and my\\ngalloping tearing tandy, o! bow to the inevitable. grin and bear it. i\\nremain with much love your brokenhearted husband d b murphy.\\n\\nthe sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a dublin resident, turned to one\\nof the jarvies with the request:\\n\\n--you don\\'t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?\\n\\nthe jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of\\nplug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was\\npassed from hand to hand.\\n\\n--thank you, the sailor said.\\n\\nhe deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow\\nstammers, proceeded:\\n\\n--we come up this morning eleven o\\'clock. the threemaster _rosevean_\\nfrom bridgwater with bricks. i shipped to get over. paid off this\\nafternoon. there\\'s my discharge. see? d. b. murphy. a. b. s.\\n\\nin confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket\\nand handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.\\n\\n--you must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked,\\nleaning on the counter.\\n\\n--why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, i\\'ve circumnavigated\\na bit since i first joined on. i was in the red sea. i was in china and\\nnorth america and south america. we was chased by pirates one voyage.\\ni seen icebergs plenty, growlers. i was in stockholm and the black sea,\\nthe dardanelles under captain dalton, the best bloody man that ever\\nscuttled a ship. i seen russia. _gospodi pomilyou_. that\\'s how the\\nrussians prays.\\n\\n--you seen queer sights, don\\'t be talking, put in a jarvey.\\n\\n--why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug. i seen\\nqueer things too, ups and downs. i seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an\\nanchor same as i chew that quid.\\n\\nhe took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his\\nteeth, bit ferociously:\\n\\n--khaan! like that. and i seen maneaters in peru that eats corpses and\\nthe livers of horses. look here. here they are. a friend of mine sent\\nme.\\n\\nhe fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to\\nbe in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table. the\\nprinted matter on it stated: _choza de indios. beni, bolivia._\\n\\nall focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage\\nwomen in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning,\\nsleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of\\nthem) outside some primitive shanties of osier.\\n\\n--chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added. stomachs\\nlike breadgraters. cuts off their diddies when they can\\'t bear no more\\nchildren.\\n\\nsee them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse\\'s liver\\nraw.\\n\\nhis postcard proved a centre of attraction for messrs the greenhorns for\\nseveral minutes if not more.\\n\\n--know how to keep them off? he inquired generally.\\n\\nnobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying:\\n\\n--glass. that boggles \\'em. glass.\\n\\nmr bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the\\ncard to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. it ran\\nas follows: _tarjeta postal, senor a boudin, galeria becche, santiago,\\nchile._ there was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.\\nthough not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the\\neggsniping transaction for that matter despite william tell and the\\nlazarillo-don cesar de bazan incident depicted in _maritana_ on which\\noccasion the former\\'s ball passed through the latter\\'s hat) having\\ndetected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person\\nhe represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours\\nafter having boxed the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and\\nthe fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some\\nsuspicions of our friend\\'s _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in\\na way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some wednesday\\nor saturday of travelling to london via long sea not to say that he had\\never travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a\\nborn adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained\\na landlubber except you call going to holyhead which was his longest.\\nmartin cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through egan but\\nsome deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that\\nthe scheme fell through. but even suppose it did come to planking\\ndown the needful and breaking boyd\\'s heart it was not so dear, purse\\npermitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to\\nmullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back.\\nthe trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in\\nevery way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was\\nout of order, seeing the different places along the route, plymouth,\\nfalmouth, southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of\\nthe sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern babylon\\nwhere doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey,\\nwealth of park lane to renew acquaintance with. another thing just\\nstruck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around\\non the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert\\ntour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts,\\nmargate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, eastbourne,\\nscarborough, margate and so on, beautiful bournemouth, the channel\\nislands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative.\\nnot, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies\\non the job, witness mrs c p m\\'coy type lend me your valise and i\\'ll post\\nyou the ticket. no, something top notch, an all star irish caste, the\\ntweedy-flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading\\nlady as a sort of counterblast to the elster grimes and moody-manners,\\nperfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing\\npuffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of\\nbounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business\\nwith pleasure. but who? that was the rub. also, without being actually\\npositive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line\\nof opening up new routes to keep pace with the times _apropos_ of the\\nfishguard-rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the\\n_tapis_ in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red\\ntape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally. a\\ngreat opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet\\nthe travelling needs of the public at large, the average man, i.e.\\nbrown, robinson and co.\\n\\nit was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no\\nsmall blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the\\nsystem really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry\\npounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead\\nof being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me\\nfor a wife. after all, hang it,

constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.\\nthere were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home\\nisland, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora\\nof attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around\\ndublin and its picturesque environs even, poulaphouca to which there was\\na steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in wicklow,\\nrightly termed the garden of ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly\\nwheelmen so long as it didn\\'t come down, and in the wilds of donegal\\nwhere if report spoke true the _coup d\\'oeil_ was exceedingly grand\\nthough the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the\\ninflux of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the\\nsignal benefits to be derived from it while howth with its historic\\nassociations and otherwise, silken thomas, grace o\\'malley, george iv,\\nrhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel

its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be\\ndesired. interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of\\ncuriosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created\\nthe route or viceversa or the two sides in fact. he turned back the\\nother side of the card, picture, and passed it along to stephen.\\n\\n--i seen a chinese one time, related the doughty

thought\\nthe park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of\\nthem using knives.\\n\\nat this remark passed obviously in the spirit of _where ignorance\\nis bliss_ mr b. and

the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid\\nfrom his boiler affair. his inscrutable face which was really a work\\nof art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed\\nthe impression that he didn\\'t understand one jot of what was going on.\\nfunny, very!\\n\\nthere ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. one man was reading in fits and\\nstarts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the\\nnatives _choza de_, another the seaman\\'s discharge. mr bloom, so far\\nas he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. he\\nvividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well\\nas yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the\\nland troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively\\nspeaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was\\njust turned fifteen.\\n\\n--ay, boss, the sailor broke in. give us back them papers.\\n\\nthe request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.\\n\\n--have you seen the rock of gibraltar? mr bloom inquired.\\n\\nthe sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or\\nno.\\n\\n--ah, you\\'ve touched there too, mr bloom said, europa point, thinking he\\nhad, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but\\nhe failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust,\\nand shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.\\n\\n--what year would that be about? mr b interrogated. can you recall the\\nboats?\\n\\nour _soi-disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before\\nanswering:\\n\\n--i\\'m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.\\nsalt junk all the time.\\n\\ntired seemingly, he ceased. his questioner perceiving that he was not\\nlikely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer,\\nfell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the\\nglobe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed,\\nit covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly\\nwhat it meant to rule the waves. on more than one occasion, a dozen\\nat the lowest, near the north bull at dollymount he had remarked a\\nsuperannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the\\nnot particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at\\nit and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone\\nsomewhere sings. and it left him wondering why. possibly he had tried to\\nfind out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes\\nand all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not exactly under,\\ntempting the fates. and the odds were twenty to nil there was really no\\nsecret about it at all. nevertheless, without going into the _minutiae_\\nof the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in\\nall its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had\\nto sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went\\nto show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the\\nother fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were\\nrun on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no\\nother lifeboat sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the\\npublic at large, no matter where living inland or seaside, as the case\\nmight be, having it brought home to them like that should extend its\\ngratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had\\nto man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the\\nseason when duty called _ireland expects that every man_ and so on and\\nsometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the\\nirish lights, kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment, rounding\\nwhich he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy,\\nnot to say stormy, weather.\\n\\n--there was a fellow sailed with me in the rover, the old seadog,\\nhimself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as\\ngentleman\\'s valet at six quid a month. them are his trousers i\\'ve on\\nme and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife. i\\'m game for that job,\\nshaving and brushup. i hate roaming about. there\\'s my son now, danny,\\nrun off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper\\'s in cork where\\nhe could be drawing easy money.\\n\\n--what age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the\\nside, bore a distant resemblance to henry campbell, the townclerk, away\\nfrom the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy\\ngetup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.\\n\\n--why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, danny?\\nhe\\'d be about eighteen now, way i figure it.\\n\\nthe skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow\\nshirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to\\nbe seen an image tattooed in blue chinese ink intended to represent an\\nanchor.\\n\\n--there was lice in that bunk in bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts.\\ni must get a wash tomorrow or next day. it\\'s them black lads i objects\\nto. i hate those buggers. suck your blood dry, they does.\\n\\nseeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged\\nhis shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the\\nmariner\\'s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a\\nyoung man\\'s sideface looking frowningly rather.\\n\\n--tattoo, the exhibitor explained. that was done when we were iying\\nbecalmed off odessa in the black sea under captain dalton. fellow, the\\nname of antonio, done that. there he is himself, a greek.\\n\\n--did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor.\\n\\nthat worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.\\nsomeway in his. squeezing or.\\n\\n--see here, he said, showing antonio. there he is cursing the mate. and\\nthere he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his\\nfingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.\\n\\nand in point of fact the young man named antonio\\'s livid face did\\nactually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the\\nunreserved admiration of everybody including skin-the-goat, who this\\ntime stretched over.\\n\\n--ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. he\\'s gone\\ntoo. ate by sharks after. ay, ay.\\n\\nhe let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression\\nof before.\\n\\n--neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.\\n\\n--and what\\'s the number for? loafer number two queried.\\n\\n--eaten alive? a third asked the sailor.\\n\\n--ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this\\ntime with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the\\ndirection of the questioner about the number. ate. a greek he was.\\n\\nand then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged\\nend:\\n\\n_--as bad as old antonio, for he left me on my ownio._\\n\\nthe face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat\\npeered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on\\nher own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. mr\\nbloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment\\nflusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink\\nsheet of the abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had\\nlaid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though\\nwhy pink. his reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment\\nround the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that\\nafternoon on ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the\\nlane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (mrs b.)\\nand begged the chance of his washing. also why washing which seemed\\nrather vague than not, your washing. still candour compelled him to\\nadmit he had washed his wife\\'s undergarments when soiled in holles\\nstreet and women would and did too a man\\'s similar garments initialled\\nwith bewley and draper\\'s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really\\nloved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt. still just\\nthen, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female\\'s room more than her\\ncompany so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude\\nsign to take herself off. round the side of the evening telegraph he\\njust caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door\\nwith a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all\\nthere, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper\\nmurphy\\'s nautical chest and then there was no more of her.\\n\\n--the gunboat, the keeper said.\\n\\n--it beats me, mr bloom confided to stephen, medically i am speaking,\\nhow a wretched creature like that from the lock hospital reeking with\\ndisease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober\\nsenses, if he values his health in the least. unfortunate creature! of\\ncourse i suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.\\nstill no matter what the cause is from...\\n\\nstephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely\\nremarking:\\n\\n--in this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a\\nroaring trade. fear not them that sell the body but have not power to\\nbuy the soul. she is a bad merchant. she buys dear and sells cheap.\\n\\nthe elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude,\\nsaid it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a\\nstop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from\\nany oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, w ere\\nnot licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing,\\nhe could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a stalwart\\nadvocate of from the very first start. whoever embarked on a policy of\\nthe sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a\\nlasting boon on everybody concerned.\\n\\n--you as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe\\nin the soul. or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such,\\nas distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup. i\\nbelieve in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as\\nthe convolutions of the grey matter. otherwise we would never have such\\ninventions as x rays, for instance. do you?\\n\\nthus cornered, stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try\\nand concentrate and remember before he could say:\\n\\n--they tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and\\ntherefore incorruptible. it would be immortal, i understand, but for the\\npossibility of its annihilation by its first cause who, from all i\\ncan hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of his other\\npractical jokes, _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both\\nbeing excluded by court etiquette.\\n\\nmr bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the\\nmystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still\\nhe felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly\\nrejoining:\\n\\n--simple? i shouldn\\'t think that is the proper word. of course, i grant\\nyou, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a\\nblue moon. but what i am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for\\ninstance to invent those rays rontgen did or the telescope like edison,\\nthough i believe it was before his time galileo was the man, i mean,\\nand the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural\\nphenomenon such as electricity but it\\'s a horse of quite another colour\\nto say you believe in the existence of a supernatural god.\\n\\n--o that, stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several\\nof the bestknown passages in holy writ, apart from circumstantial\\nevidence.\\n\\non this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they\\nwere both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in\\ntheir respective ages, clashed.\\n\\n--has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his\\noriginal point with a smile of unbelief. i\\'m not so sure about that.\\nthat\\'s a matter for everyman\\'s opinion and, without dragging in the\\nsectarian side of the business, i beg to differ with you _in toto_\\nthere. my belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were\\ngenuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it\\'s the\\nbig question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them\\nlike _hamlet_ and bacon, as, you who know your shakespeare infinitely\\nbetter than i, of course i needn\\'t tell you. can\\'t you drink that\\ncoffee, by the way? let me stir it. and take a piece of that bun. it\\'s\\nlike one of our skipper\\'s bricks disguised. still no-one can give what\\nhe hasn\\'t got. try a bit.\\n\\n--couldn\\'t, stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the\\nmoment refusing to dictate further.\\n\\nfaultfinding being a proverbially bad hat mr bloom thought well to stir\\nor try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something\\napproaching acrimony on the coffee palace and its temperance (and\\nlucrative) work. to be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or\\nnay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in\\nrun on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings\\nand useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower\\norders. on the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection\\nthey paid his wife, madam marion tweedy who had been prominently\\nassociated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for\\nher pianoplaying. the idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was\\nto do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak\\nof. sulphate of copper poison so4 or something in some dried peas he\\nremembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn\\'t\\nremember when it was or where. anyhow inspection, medical inspection,\\nof all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly\\naccounted for the vogue of dr tibble\\'s vi-cocoa on account of the\\nmedical analysis involved.\\n\\n--have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being\\nstirred.\\n\\nthus prevailed on to at any rate taste it stephen lifted the heavy mug\\nfrom the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and\\ntook a sip of the offending beverage.\\n\\n--still it\\'s solid food, his good genius urged, i\\'m a stickler for solid\\nfood, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but\\nregular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work, mental\\nor manual. you ought to eat more solid food. you would feel a different\\nman.\\n\\n--liquids i can eat, stephen said. but o, oblige me by taking away that\\nknife. i can\\'t look at the point of it. it reminds me of roman history.\\n\\nmr bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article,\\na blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly roman or\\nantique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least\\nconspicuous point about it.\\n\\n--our mutual friend\\'s stories are like himself, mr bloom _apropos_ of\\nknives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_. do you think they are\\ngenuine? he could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and\\nlie like old boots. look at him.\\n\\nyet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was\\nfull of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it\\nwas quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an\\nentire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent\\nprobability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly\\naccurate gospel.\\n\\nhe had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and\\nsherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him. though a\\nwellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness,\\nthere was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail\\ndelivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate\\nsuch a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity. he\\nmight even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told,\\nas people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself\\nand had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say\\nnothing of the antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage\\nof identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who\\nexpiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described. on the\\nother hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because\\nmeeting unmistakable mugs, dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting\\nnews from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean\\nseas to draw the long bow about the schooner _hesperus_ and etcetera.\\nand when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself\\ncouldn\\'t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers\\nother fellows coined about him.\\n\\n--mind you, i\\'m not saying that it\\'s all a pure invention, he resumed.\\nanalogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. giants,\\nthough that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, marcella the\\nmidget queen. in those waxworks in henry street i myself saw some\\naztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn\\'t straighten\\ntheir legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he\\nproceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews\\nor whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly\\npowerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as\\ngods. there\\'s an example again of simple souls.\\n\\nhowever reverting to friend sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who\\nreminded him a bit of ludwig, _alias_ ledwidge, when he occupied\\nthe boards of the gaiety when michael gunn was identified with the\\nmanagement in the _flying dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host\\nof admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him\\nthough ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually\\nfell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically\\nincompatible about it, he conceded. on the contrary that stab in the\\nback touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he\\nwas none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish\\nway not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little\\nitaly there near the coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows\\nexcept perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary\\nanimal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good\\nold succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or her next day on\\nthe quiet and, he added, on the cheap.\\n\\n--spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like\\nthat, impetuous as old nick, are given to taking the law into their own\\nhands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they\\ncarry in the abdomen. it comes from the great heat, climate generally.\\nmy wife is, so to speak, spanish, half that is. point of fact she could\\nactually claim spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in\\n(technically) spain, i.e. gibraltar. she has the spanish type. quite\\ndark, regular brunette, black. i for one certainly believe climate\\naccounts for character. that\\'s why i asked you if you wrote your poetry\\nin italian.\\n\\n--the temperaments at the door, stephen interposed with, were very\\npassionate about ten shillings. _roberto ruba roba sua_.\\n\\n--quite so, mr bloom dittoed.\\n\\n--then, stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown\\nlistener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of dante and the isosceles\\ntriangle miss portinari he fell in love with and leonardo and san\\ntommaso mastino.\\n\\n--it\\'s in the blood, mr bloom acceded at once. all are washed in the\\nblood of the sun. coincidence i just happened to be in the kildare\\nstreet museum 890 today, shortly prior to our meeting if i can so call\\nit, and i was just looking at those antique statues there. the splendid\\nproportions of hips, bosom. you simply don\\'t knock against those kind of\\nwomen here. an exception here and there. handsome yes, pretty in a way\\nyou find but what i\\'m talking about is the female form. besides they\\nhave so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a\\nwoman\\'s natural beauty, no matter what you say. rumpled stockings, it\\nmay be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it\\'s a thing i simply\\nhate to see.\\n\\ninterest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the\\nothers got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog,\\ngoo collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing. shipahoy of course\\nhad his own say to say. he had doubled the cape a few odd times and\\nweathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the china seas and through all\\nthose perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him\\nor words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.\\n\\nso then after that they drifted on to the wreck off daunt\\'s rock, wreck\\nof that illfated norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for\\nthe moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of henry campbell\\nremembered it _palme_ on booterstown strand. that was the talk of the\\ntown that year (albert william quill wrote a fine piece of original\\nverse of 910 distinctive merit on the topic for the irish _times_),\\nbreakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in\\ncommotion petrified with horror. then someone said something about the\\ncase of the s. s. _lady cairns_ of swansea run into by the _mona_ which\\nwas on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all\\nhands on deck. no aid was given. her master, the _mona\\'s_, said he\\nwas afraid his collision bulkhead would give way. she had no water, it\\nappears, in her hold.\\n\\nat this stage an incident happened. it having become necessary for him\\nto unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.\\n\\n--let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just\\ngently dropping off into a peaceful doze.\\n\\nhe made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door,\\nstepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore\\ndue left. while he was in the act of getting his bearings mr bloom who\\nnoticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship\\'s\\nrum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his\\nburning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and,\\napplying its nozz1e to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of\\nit with a gurgling noise. the irrepressible bloom, who also had a\\nshrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manoeuvre after the\\ncounterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared\\nto all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when\\nduly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and\\ngirders of the loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all\\nradically altered since his last visit and greatly improved. some person\\nor persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the\\ncleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief\\nspace of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently\\ngiving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his\\nbilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where\\nit apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank. a hoof scooped anyway for\\nnew foothold after sleep and harness jingled. slightly disturbed in his\\nsentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation\\nstones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other\\nin stern reality than the gumley aforesaid, now practically on the\\nparish rates, given the temporary job by pat tobin in all human\\nprobability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about\\nand shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms\\nof morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent\\nform on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent\\nhome comforts all his life who came in for a cool 100 pounds a year\\nat one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make\\ngeneral ducks and drakes of. and there he was at the end of his tether\\nafter having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly\\nstiver. he drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a\\nmoral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if--a\\nbig if, however--he had contrived to cure himself of his particular\\npartiality.\\n\\nall meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in irish shipping,\\ncoastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same\\nthing. a palgrave murphy boat was put off the ways at alexandra basin,\\nthe only launch that year. right enough the harbours were there only no\\nships ever called.\\n\\nthere were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidently _au\\nfait_.\\n\\nwhat he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only\\nrock in galway bay when the galway harbour scheme was mooted by a mr\\nworthington or some name like that, eh? ask the then captain, he advised\\nthem, how much palmoil the british government gave him for that day\\'s\\nwork, captain john lever of the lever line.\\n\\n--am i right, skipper? he queried of the sailor, now returning after his\\nprivate potation and the rest of his exertions.\\n\\nthat worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words\\ngrowled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other\\nin seconds or thirds. mr bloom\\'s sharp ears heard him then expectorate\\nthe plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the\\ntime being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs\\nand found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question. anyhow in\\nhe rolled after his successful libation-_cum_-potation, introducing an\\natmosphere of drink into the _soiree_, boisterously trolling, like a\\nveritable son of a seacook:\\n\\n     _--the biscuits was as hard as brass\\n     and the beef as salt as lot\\'s wife\\'s arse.\\n     o, johnny lever!\\n     johnny lever, o!_\\n\\nafter which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene\\nand regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form\\nprovided. skin-the-goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to\\ngrind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent\\nthe natural resources of ireland or something of that sort which he\\ndescribed in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on\\nthe face of god\\'s earth, far and away superior to england, with coal in\\nlarge quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year,\\nten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of\\nit by england levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the\\nnose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more\\nsurplus steam in the same vein. their conversation accordingly became\\ngeneral and all agreed that that was a fact. you could grow any mortal\\nthing in irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel everard down\\nthere in navan growing tobacco. where would you find anywhere the like\\nof irish bacon? but a day of reckoning, he stated _crescendo_ with no\\nuncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in\\nstore for mighty england, despite her power of pelf on account of her\\ncrimes. there would be a fall and the greatest fall in history.\\nthe germans and the japs were going to have their little lookin, he\\naffirmed. the boers were the beginning of the end. brummagem england was\\ntoppling already and her downfall would be ireland, her achilles heel,\\nwhich he explained to them about the vulnerable point of achilles, the\\ngreek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped\\ntheir attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot. his\\nadvice to every irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work\\nfor ireland and live for ireland. ireland, parnell said, could not spare\\na single one of her sons.\\n\\nsilence all round marked the termination of his _finale_. the impervious\\nnavigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.\\n\\n--take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a\\nbit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.\\n\\nto which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper\\nconcurred but nevertheless held to his main view.\\n\\n--who\\'s the best troops in the army? the grizzled old veteran irately\\ninterrogated. and the best jumpers and racers? and the best admirals and\\ngenerals we\\'ve got? tell me that.\\n\\n--the irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like campbell, facial\\nblemishes apart.\\n\\n--that\\'s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. the irish catholic\\npeasant. he\\'s the backbone of our empire. you know jem mullins?\\n\\nwhile allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added\\nhe cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no irishman\\nworthy of his salt that served it. then they began to have a few\\nirascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing\\nto the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long\\nas they didn\\'t indulge in recriminations and come to blows.\\n\\nfrom inside information extending over a series of years mr bloom was\\nrather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for,\\npending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was\\nfully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel,\\nunless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather\\nconcealed their strength than the opposite. it was quite on a par with\\nthe quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years\\nthe coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as\\ntime went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could\\npersonally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies,\\nequally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly\\nadvisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even\\nthough poles apart. another little interesting point, the amours of\\nwhores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him irish\\nsoldiers had as often fought for england as against her, more so, in\\nfact. and now, why? so the scene between the pair of them, the licensee\\nof the place rumoured to be or have been fitzharris, the famous\\ninvincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as\\nbeing on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was\\nprearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human soul if anything,\\nthe others seeing least of the game. and as for the lessee or keeper,\\nwho probably wasn\\'t the other person at all, he (b.) couldn\\'t help\\nfeeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the\\ngoby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have\\nanything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their\\nfelonsetting, there always being the offchance of a dannyman coming\\nforward and turning queen\\'s evidence or king\\'s now like denis or peter\\ncarey, an idea he utterly repudiated. quite apart from that he disliked\\nthose careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle. yet, though such\\ncriminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any\\nshape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while inwardly\\nremaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man who\\nhad actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his\\npolitical convictions (though, personally, he would never be a party to\\nany such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south,\\nhave her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words\\npassed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky\\nmortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on\\nhis adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial _liaison_\\nby plunging his knife into her, until it just struck him that\\nfitz, nicknamed skin-the-goat, merely drove the car for the actual\\nperpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed,\\nactually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some\\nlegal luminary saved his skin on. in any case that was very ancient\\nhistory by now and as for our friend, the pseudo skin-the-etcetera, he\\nhad transparently outlived his welcome. he ought to have either died\\nnaturally or on the scaffold high. like actresses, always farewell\\npositively last performance then come up smiling again. generous to a\\nfault of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort,\\nalways snapping at the bone for the shadow. so similarly he had a very\\nshrewd suspicion that mr johnny lever got rid of some l s d. in the\\ncourse of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere\\nof the _old ireland_ tavern, come back to erin and so on. then as for\\nthe other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he\\ntold stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender.\\n\\n--he took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the\\nwhole eventempered person declared, i let slip. he called me a jew and\\nin a heated fashion offensively. so i without deviating from plain facts\\nin the least told him his god, i mean christ, was a jew too and all his\\nfamily like me though in reality i\\'m not. that was one for him. a soft\\nanswer turns away wrath. he hadn\\'t a word to say for himself as everyone\\nsaw. am i not right?\\n\\nhe turned a long you are wrong gaze on stephen of timorous dark pride\\nat the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to\\nglean in a kind of a way that it wasn\\'t all exactly.\\n\\n--_ex quibus_, stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or\\nfour eyes conversing, _christus_ or bloom his name is or after all any\\nother, _secundum carnem_.\\n\\n--of course, mr b. proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides\\nof the question. it is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to\\nright and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is\\nthough every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the\\ngovernment it deserves. but with a little goodwill all round. it\\'s all\\nvery fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality.\\ni resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form. it never\\nreaches anything or stops anything. a revolution must come on the due\\ninstalments plan. it\\'s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate\\npeople because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular,\\nin the next house so to speak.\\n\\n--memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes\\' war, stephen\\nassented, between skinner\\'s alley and ormond market.\\n\\nyes, mr bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that\\nwas overwhelmingly right. and the whole world was full of that sort of\\nthing.\\n\\n--you just took the words out of my mouth, he said. a hocuspocus of\\nconflicting evidence that candidly you couldn\\'t remotely...\\n\\nall those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up\\nbad blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind,\\nerroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were\\nvery largely a question of the money question which was at the back of\\neverything greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.\\n\\n--they accuse, remarked he audibly.\\n\\nhe turned away from the others who probably and spoke nearer to, so as\\nthe others in case they.\\n\\n--jews, he softly imparted in an aside in stephen\\'s ear, are accused of\\nruining. not a vestige of truth in it, i can safely say. history, would\\nyou be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt spain decayed when the\\ninquisition hounded the jews out and england prospered when cromwell,\\nan uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for,\\nimported them. why? because they are imbued with the proper spirit. they\\nare practical and are proved to be so. i don\\'t want to indulge in any\\nbecause you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as\\nyou are. but in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest\\nspells poverty. spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead\\namerica. turks. it\\'s in the dogma. because if they didn\\'t believe they\\'d\\ngo straight to heaven when they die they\\'d try to live better, at least\\nso i think. that\\'s the juggle on which the p.p\\'s raise the wind on false\\npretences. i\\'m, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an irishman\\nas that rude person i told you about at the outset and i want to see\\neveryone, concluded he, all creeds and classes _pro rata_ having a\\ncomfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something\\nin the neighbourhood of 300 pounds per annum. that\\'s the vital issue\\nat stake and it\\'s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier\\nintercourse between man and man. at least that\\'s my idea for what it\\'s\\nworth. i call that patriotism. _ubi patria_, as we learned a smattering\\nof in our classical days in _alma mater, vita bene_. where you can live\\nwell, the sense is, if you work.\\n\\nover his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this\\nsynopsis of things in general, stephen stared at nothing in particular.\\nhe could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those\\ncrabs about ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours\\nof different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere\\nbeneath or seemed to. then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or\\ndidn\\'t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.\\n\\n--count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.\\n\\nthe eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person\\nwho owned them pro tem. observed or rather his voice speaking did, all\\nmust work, have to, together.\\n\\n--i mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest\\npossible sense. also literary labour not merely for the kudos of\\nthe thing. writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel\\nnowadays. that\\'s work too. important work. after all, from the little\\ni know of you, after all the money expended on your education you are\\nentitled to recoup yourself and command your price. you have every bit\\nas much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the\\npeasant has. what? you both belong to ireland, the brain and the brawn.\\neach is equally important.\\n\\n--you suspect, stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that i may\\nbe important because i belong to the _faubourg saint patrice_ called\\nireland for short.\\n\\n--i would go a step farther, mr bloom insinuated.\\n\\n--but i suspect, stephen interrupted, that ireland must be important\\nbecause it belongs to me.\\n\\n--what belongs, queried mr bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under\\nsome misapprehension. excuse me. unfortunately, i didn\\'t catch the\\nlatter portion. what was it you...?\\n\\nstephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of\\ncoffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding: 1170\\n\\n--we can\\'t change the country. let us change the subject.\\n\\nat this pertinent suggestion mr bloom, to change the subject, looked\\ndown but in a quandary, as he couldn\\'t tell exactly what construction\\nto put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. the rebuke of some\\nkind was clearer than the other part. needless to say the fumes of\\nhis recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way\\nforeign to his sober state. probably the homelife to which mr b attached\\nthe utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn\\'t\\nbeen familiarised with the right sort of people. with a touch of fear\\nfor the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air\\nof some consternation remembering he had just come back from paris,\\nthe eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister,\\nfailing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind\\ninstances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the\\nbud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves. for instance\\nthere was the case of o\\'callaghan, for

their\\nmemories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and\\nnot singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it\\nwas twenty odd years. highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow\\nof truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly\\ninadvisable, all things considered. something evidently riled them in\\nhis death. either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when\\nhis various different political arrangements were nearing completion\\nor whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to\\nchange his boots and clothes-after a wetting when a cold resulted and\\nfailing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he\\neventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at\\nan end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken\\nout of their hands. of course nobody being acquainted with his movements\\neven before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which\\nwere decidedly of the _alice, where art thou_ order even prior to his\\nstarting to go under several aliases such as fox and stewart so the\\nremark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of\\npossibility. naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader\\nof men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter\\nor at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas\\nmessrs so and so who, though they weren\\'t even a patch on the former\\nman, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and\\nfar between. it certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay,\\nand then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual\\nmudslinging. and the

you were a lucky dog if\\nthey didn\\'t set the terrier at you directly you got back. then a lot of\\nshillyshally usually followed, tom for and dick and harry against. and\\nthen, number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to\\nproduce your credentials like the claimant in the tichborne case,\\nroger charles tichborne, _bella_ was the boat\\'s name to the best of his\\nrecollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence went to show\\nand there was a tattoo mark too in indian ink, lord bellew was it, as he\\nmight very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship\\nand then, when got up to tally with the description given, introduce\\nhimself with: _excuse me, my name is so and so_ or some such commonplace\\nremark. a more prudent course, as bloom said to the not over effusive,\\nin fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him,\\nwould have been to sound the lie of the land first.\\n\\n--that bitch, that english whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor\\ncommented. she put the first nail in his coffin.\\n\\n--fine lump of a woman all the same, the _soi-disant_ townclerk henry\\ncampbell remarked, and plenty of her. she loosened many a man\\'s thighs.\\ni seen her picture in a barber\\'s. the husband was a captain or an\\nofficer.\\n\\n--ay, skin-the-goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.\\n\\nthis gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair\\namount of laughter among his _entourage_. as regards bloom he, without\\nthe faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of\\nthe door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused\\nextraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters\\nworse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed\\nbetween them full of sweet nothings. first it was strictly platonic till\\nnature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by\\nbit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town\\ntill the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few\\nevildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall\\nthough the thing was public property all along though not to anything\\nlike the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into. since\\ntheir names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite,\\nwhere was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file\\nfrom the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom\\nwhich came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the\\npacked court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses\\nswearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in\\nthe act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance\\nof a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same\\nfashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply\\ncoined shoals of money out of. whereas the simple fact of the case was\\nit was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with\\nnothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man\\narriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim\\nto her siren charms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask\\nin the loved one\\'s smiles. the eternal question of the life connubial,\\nneedless to say, cropped up. can real love, supposing there happens to\\nbe another chap in the case, exist between married folk? poser.\\nthough it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with\\naffection, carried away by a wave of folly. a magnificent specimen of\\nmanhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order, as\\ncompared with the other military supernumerary that is (who was just the\\nusual everyday _farewell, my gallant captain_ kind of an individual in\\nthe light dragoons, the 18th hussars to be accurate) and inflammable\\ndoubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own\\npeculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly\\nlikely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the\\npriests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch\\nadherents, and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman\\nservice in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on\\ntheir behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations,\\nvery effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of\\nfire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass\\'s kick. looking\\nback now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of\\ndream. and then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it\\nwent without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved\\nwith the times. why, as he reflected, irishtown strand, a locality he\\nhad not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow\\nsince, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side. north or\\nsouth, however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and\\nsimple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the\\nvery thing he was saying as she also was spanish or half so, types that\\nwouldn\\'t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting\\nevery shred of decency to the winds.\\n\\n--just bears out what i was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to\\nstephen, about blood and the sun. and, if i don\\'t greatly mistake she\\nwas spanish too.\\n\\n--the king of spain\\'s daughter, stephen answered, adding something or\\nother rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you

that rumour before. possible, especially there, it\\nwas as she lived there. so, spain.\\n\\ncarefully avoiding a book in his pocket _sweets of_, which reminded him\\nby the by of that cap l street library book out of date, he took out his\\npocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly\\nfinally he.\\n\\n--do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded\\nphoto which he laid on the table, that a spanish type?\\n\\nstephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large\\nsized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she\\nwas in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously\\nlow for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than\\nvision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing\\nnear, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was _in old\\nmadrid_, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue. her\\n(the lady\\'s) eyes, dark, large, looked at stephen, about to smile about\\nsomething to be admired, lafayette of westmoreland street, dublin\\'s\\npremier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic\\nexecution.\\n\\n--mrs bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ madam marion tweedy, bloom\\nindicated. taken a few years since. in or about ninety six. very like\\nher then.\\n\\nbeside the young

a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years\\nnumbered barely sweet sixteen. as for the face it was a speaking\\nlikeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which\\ncame in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the\\nbest advantage in that getup. she could without difficulty, he said,\\nhave posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of\\nthe. he dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female\\nform in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later\\nthan that afternoon he had seen those grecian statues, 1450 perfectly\\ndeveloped as works of art, in the national museum. marble could give\\nthe original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest. yes,\\npuritanisme, it does though saint joseph\\'s sovereign thievery alors\\n(bandez!) figne toi trop. whereas no photo could because it simply\\nwasn\\'t art in a word.\\n\\nthe spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow jack tar\\'s good\\nexample and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for\\nitself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for\\nhimself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the\\ncamera could not at all do justice to. but it was scarcely professional\\netiquette so. though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet\\nwonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm.\\nand he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a\\nkind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion.\\nnevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased\\nby opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away\\nthoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the\\nother\\'s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving\\n_embonpoint_. in fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like\\nthe case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact\\nwith the starch out. suppose she was gone when he? i looked for the lamp\\nwhich she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of\\nhis because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and\\nthe book about ruby with met him pike hoses (_sic_) in it which must\\nhave fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot\\nwith apologies to lindley murray.\\n\\nthe vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated,\\n_distingue_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the\\nbunch though you wouldn\\'t think he had it in him yet you would. besides\\nhe said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though\\nat the moment she was distinctly stouter. and why not? an awful lot of\\nmakebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur\\nwith the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial\\ntangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest\\nstage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole\\nbusiness. how they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up\\nbetween the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye\\nwas told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and\\ncompromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly\\ncohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and\\nrelations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course\\nintimate. then the decree _nisi_ and the king\\'s proctor tries to show\\ncause why and, he failing to quash it, _nisi_ was made absolute. but as\\nfor that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one\\nanother, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till\\nthe matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for\\nthe party wronged in due course. he, b, enjoyed the distinction of being\\nclose to erin\\'s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on\\nthe historic _fracas_ when the fallen leader\\'s, who notoriously stuck to\\nhis guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery,\\n(leader\\'s) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or\\npossibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the\\n_insuppressible_ or no it was _united ireland_ (a by no means by the\\nby appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or\\nsomething like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from\\nthe facile pens of the o\\'brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging\\noccupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune\\'s private morals. though\\npalpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though\\ncarelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went\\na long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast\\ndiscomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a\\npedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive. as those were\\nparticularly hot times in the general hullaballoo bloom sustained a\\nminor injury from a nasty prod of some chap\\'s elbow in the crowd that\\nof course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach,\\nfortunately not of a grave character. his hat (parnell\\'s) a silk one was\\ninadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, bloom was\\nthe man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence\\nmeaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost\\ncelerity) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away\\nfrom his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a\\nstake in the country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more\\nfor the kudos of the thing than anything else, what\\'s bred in the bone\\ninstilled into him in infancy at his mother\\'s knee in the shape of\\nknowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to\\nthe donor and thanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _thank you,\\nsir_, though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the\\nlegal profession whose headgear bloom also set to rights earlier in the\\ncourse of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after\\nthe burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory\\nafter the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.\\n\\non the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes\\nof the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing 1530\\nimmoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the\\nwherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case\\nfor the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate\\nhusband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from\\nthe usual boy jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial\\nmoment in a loving position locked in one another\\'s arms, drawing\\nattention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic\\nrumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and\\nmaster upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not\\nreceive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook\\nthe matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though\\npossibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite\\npossibly there were several others. he personally, being of a sceptical\\nbias, believed and didn\\'t make the smallest bones about saying so either\\nthat man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting\\nlist about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world\\nand they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when,\\nneglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on\\nfor a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on\\nher with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred\\non another, the cause of many _liaisons_ between still attractive\\nmarried women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as\\nseveral famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.\\n\\nit was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of\\nbrains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time\\nwith profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him\\nhis lifetime. in the nature of single blessedness he would one day take\\nunto himself a wife when miss right came on the scene but in the interim\\nladies\\' society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the gravest\\npossible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump stephen\\nabout miss ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who\\nbrought him down to irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he\\nwould find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea\\nand the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or\\ntriweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and\\nwalking out leading up to fond lovers\\' ways and flowers and chocs. to\\nthink of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any\\nstepmother, was really too bad at his age. the queer suddenly things\\nhe popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the\\nother\\'s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly\\nought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal\\nnutriment or, failing that, the homely humpty dumpty boiled.\\n\\n--at what o\\'clock did you dine? he questioned of the slim form and tired\\nthough unwrinkled face.\\n\\n--some time yesterday, stephen said.\\n\\n--yesterday! exclaimed bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow\\nfriday. ah, you mean it\\'s after twelve!\\n\\n--the day before yesterday, stephen said, improving on himself.\\n\\nliterally astounded at this piece of intelligence bloom reflected.\\nthough they didn\\'t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there\\nsomehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the\\none train of thought. at his age when dabbling in politics roughly\\nsome score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to\\nparliamentary honours in the buckshot foster days he too recollected in\\nretrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had\\na sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas. for instance when the\\nevicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in\\npeople\\'s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper\\nor pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn\\'t\\nexactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in\\nthorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern\\nopinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was\\nsubsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted with going a\\nstep farther than michael davitt in the striking views he at one time\\ninculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly\\nresented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our\\nfriend at the gathering of the clans in barney kiernan\\'s so that he,\\nthough often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of\\nmortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give\\nhim (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics\\nthemselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties\\ninvariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity\\nand the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on\\nfine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.\\n\\nanyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it\\nwas, it was high time to be retiring for the night. the crux was it\\nwas a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue\\n(somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash\\naltogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed\\nunknown) with a lame paw (not that the cases were either identical or\\nthe reverse though he had hurt his hand too) to ontario terrace as he\\nvery distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak. on the\\nother hand it was altogether far and away too late for the sandymount\\nor sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of\\nthe two alternatives. everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him\\nto avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered.\\nhis initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over\\neffusive but it grew on him someway. for one thing he mightn\\'t what you\\ncall jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was\\nhe didn\\'t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he\\ndid entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal\\npleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some\\nwardrobe, if found suitable. at all events he wound up by concluding,\\neschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of epps\\'s cocoa and\\na shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat\\ndoubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as\\na toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm\\nin that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up.\\na move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower\\nin question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn\\'t appear in any\\nparticular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved queenstown\\nand it was highly likely some sponger\\'s bawdyhouse of retired beauties\\nwhere age was no bar off sheriff street lower would be the best clue\\nto that equivocal character\\'s whereabouts for a few days to come,\\nalternately racking their feelings (the mermaids\\') with sixchamber\\nrevolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze\\nthe marrow of anybody\\'s bones and mauling their largesized charms\\nbetweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large\\npotations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who\\nhe in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as mr algebra\\nremarks _passim_. at the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle\\nrepartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew.\\npeople could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled\\nthem was a bite from a sheep. the most vulnerable point too of tender\\nachilles. your god was a jew. because mostly they appeared to imagine he\\ncame from carrick-on-shannon or somewhereabouts in the county sligo.\\n\\n--i propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while\\nprudently pocketing her photo, as it\\'s rather stuffy here you just come\\nhome with me and talk things over. my diggings are quite close in the\\nvicinity. you can\\'t drink that stuff. do you like cocoa? wait. i\\'ll just\\npay this lot.\\n\\nthe best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain\\nsailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper\\nof the shanty who didn\\'t seem to.\\n\\n--yes, that\\'s the best, he assured stephen to whom for the matter of\\nthat brazen head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.\\n\\nall kinds of utopian plans were flashing through his (b\\'s) busy brain,\\neducation (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits,\\nup to date billing, concert tours in english watering resorts packed\\nwith hydros and seaside theatres, turning money away, duets in italian\\nwith the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other\\nthings, no necessity, of course, to tell the world and his wife from the\\nhousetops about it, and a slice of luck. an opening was all was wanted.\\nbecause he more than suspected he had his father\\'s voice to bank his\\nhopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as\\nwell, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of\\nthat particular red herring just to.\\n\\nthe cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former\\nviceroy, earl cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers\\' association\\ndinner in london somewhere. silence with a yawn or two accompanied this\\nthrilling announcement. then the old specimen in the corner who appeared\\nto have some spark of vitality left read out that sir anthony macdonnell\\nhad left euston for the chief secretary\\'s lodge or words to that effect.\\nto which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why.\\n\\n--give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner\\nput in, manifesting some natural impatience.\\n\\n--and welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.\\n\\nthe sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles\\nwhich he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.\\n\\n--are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the townclerk\\nqueried.\\n\\n--why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was\\na bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen\\nportholes as you might well describe them as, i uses goggles reading.\\nsand in the red sea done that. one time i could read a book in the dark,\\nmanner of speaking. _the arabian nights entertainment_ was my favourite\\nand _red as a rose is she._\\n\\nhereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon lord only knows what,\\nfound drowned or the exploits of king willow, iremonger having made a\\nhundred and something second wicket not out for notts, during which\\ntime (completely regardless of ire) the keeper was intensely occupied\\nloosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched\\nhim as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were\\nsufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions,\\nthat is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial\\nremark.\\n\\nto cut a long story short bloom, grasping the situation, was the first\\nto rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first\\nand foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for\\nthe occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine\\nhost as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were\\nnot looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a\\ngrand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in\\nfour coppers, literally the last of the mohicans), he having previously\\nspotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him\\nin unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly well\\nworth twice the money once in a way, as wetherup used to remark.\\n\\n--come, he counselled to close the _seance_.\\n\\nseeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the\\nshelter or shanty together and the _elite_ society of oilskin and\\ncompany whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their\\n_dolce far niente_. stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and\\nfagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door.\\n\\n--one thing i never understood, he said to be original on the spur of\\nthe moment. why they put tables upside down at night, i mean chairs\\nupside down, on the tables in cafes. to which impromptu the neverfailing\\nbloom replied without a moment\\'s hesitation, saying straight off:\\n\\n--to sweep the floor in the morning.\\n\\nso saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same\\ntime apologetic to get on his companion\\'s right, a habit of his, by the\\nbye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender achilles. the\\nnight air was certainly now a treat to breathe though stephen was a bit\\nweak on his pins.\\n\\n--it will (the air) do you good, bloom said, meaning also the walk, in\\na moment. the only thing is to walk then you\\'ll feel a different man.\\ncome. it\\'s not far. lean on me.\\n\\naccordingly he passed his left arm in stephen\\'s right and led him on\\naccordingly.\\n\\n--yes, stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange\\nkind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and\\nall that.\\n\\nanyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc. where\\nthe municipal supernumerary, ex gumley, was still to all intents and\\npurposes wrapped in the arms of murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming\\nof fresh fields and pastures new. and _apropos_ of coffin of stones the\\nanalogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the\\npart of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the\\ntime of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the\\nselfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.\\n\\nso they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which\\nbloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made\\ntracks arm in arm across beresford place. wagnerian music, though\\nconfessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for bloom and hard to\\nfollow at the first go-off but the music of mercadante\\'s _huguenots_,\\nmeyerbeer\\'s _seven last words on the cross_ and mozart\\'s _twelfth mass_\\nhe simply revelled in, the _gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the acme\\nof first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into\\na cocked hat. he infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic\\nchurch to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as\\nthose moody and sankey hymns or _bid me to live and i will live\\nthy protestant to be_. he also yielded to none in his admiration of\\nrossini\\'s _stabat mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers,\\nin which his wife, madam marion tweedy, made a hit, a veritable\\nsensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laureis and\\nputting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers\\' church\\nin upper gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the\\ndoors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather. there was the\\nunanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it\\nto say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was\\na generally voiced desire for an encore. on the whole though favouring\\npreferably light opera of the _don giovanni_ description and _martha_,\\na gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface\\nknowledge, for the severe classical school such as mendelssohn. and\\ntalking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old\\nfavourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ lionel\\'s air in _martha,\\nm\\'appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be\\nmore accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the\\nlips of stephen\\'s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the\\nnumber, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat. stephen, in\\nreply to a politely put query, said he didn\\'t sing it but launched\\nout into praises of shakespeare\\'s songs, at least of in or about that\\nperiod, the lutenist dowland who lived in fetter lane near gerard the\\nherbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, doulandus_, an instrument he was\\ncontemplating purchasing from mr arnold dolmetsch, whom b. did not quite\\nrecall though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas\\nand farnaby and son with their _dux_ and _comes_ conceits and byrd\\n(william) who played the virginals, he said, in the queen\\'s chapel or\\nanywhere else he found them and one tomkins who made toys or airs and\\njohn bull.\\n\\non the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond\\nthe swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground,\\nbrushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise bloom was not\\nperfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive\\nguineas and john bull. he inquired if it was john bull the political\\ncelebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a\\nstriking coincidence.\\n\\nby the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, bloom,\\nwho was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other\\'s sleeve\\ngently, jocosely remarking:\\n\\n--our lives are in peril tonight. beware of the steamroller.\\n\\nthey thereupon stopped. bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth\\nanything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite\\nnear so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh\\nbecause palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a\\ntaildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the\\nlord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. but such\\na good poor brute he was sorry he hadn\\'t a lump of sugar but, as he\\nwisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency\\nthat might crop up. he was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a\\nhorse, without a second care in the world. but even a dog, he reflected,\\ntake that mongrel in barney kiernan\\'s, of the same size, would be a holy\\nhorror to face. but it was no animal\\'s fault in particular if he was\\nbuilt that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes\\ninto potheen in his hump. nine tenths of them all could be caged or\\ntrained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees. whale with a\\nharpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the\\njoke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye. these timely\\nreflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat\\ndistracted from stephen\\'s words while the ship of the street was\\nmanoeuvring and stephen went on about the highly interesting old.\\n\\n--what\\'s this i was saying? ah, yes! my wife, he intimated, plunging\\n_in medias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your\\nacquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.\\n\\nhe looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of stephen,\\nimage of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome\\nblackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as\\nhe was perhaps not that way built.\\n\\nstill, supposing he had his father\\'s gift as he more than suspected,\\nit opened up new vistas in his mind such as lady fingall\\'s irish\\nindustries, concert on the preceding monday, and aristocracy in general.\\n\\nexquisite variations he was now describing on an air _youth here has\\nend_ by jans pieter sweelinck, a dutchman of amsterdam where the frows\\ncome from. even more he liked an old german song of _johannes jeep_\\nabout the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men,\\nwhich boggled bloom a bit:\\n\\n     _von der sirenen listigkeit\\n     tun die poeten dichten._\\n\\nthese opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_. bloom, nodding,\\nsaid he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which\\nhe did.\\n\\na phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons,\\nwhich bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily,\\nif properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production\\nsuch as barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain,\\ncommand its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for\\nits fortunate possessor in the near future an _entree_ into fashionable\\nhouses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large\\nway of business and titled people where with his university degree of\\nb. a. (a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more\\ninfluence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct\\nsuccess, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the\\npurpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended\\nto so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a\\nyouthful tyro in--society\\'s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a\\nlittle thing like that could militate against you. it was in fact only a\\nmatter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their\\nmusical and artistic _conversaziones_ during the festivities of the\\nchristmas season, for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes\\nof the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation,\\ncases of which, as he happened to know, were on record--in fact, without\\ngiving the show away, he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could\\neasily have. added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument\\nby no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition\\nfees. not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need\\nnecessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy\\nspace of time. but a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or\\nnay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his\\ndignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to\\nbe handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped.\\nbesides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original\\nmusic like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly\\nhave a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for dublin\\'s musical\\nworld after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a\\nconfiding public by ivan st austell and hilton st just and their _genus\\nomne_. yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in\\nhis hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win\\na high place in the city\\'s esteem where he could command a stiff figure\\nand, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the king\\nstreet house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him\\nupstairs, so to speak, a big _if_, however, with some impetus of the\\ngoahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often\\ntripped-up a too much feted prince of good fellows. and it need not\\ndetract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would\\nhave heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when\\ndesirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or\\ncontaining anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself\\nalone. in fact, he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason\\nwhy the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat\\nof any sort, hung on to him at all.\\n\\nthe horse was just then. and later on at a propitious opportunity he\\npurposed (bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on\\nthe _fools step in where angels_ principle, advising him to sever his\\nconnection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was\\nprone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious\\npretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it\\nwhich in bloom\\'s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of\\na person\\'s character, no pun intended.\\n\\nthe horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and,\\nrearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on\\nthe floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking\\nglobes of turds. slowly three times, one after another, from a full\\ncrupper he mired. and humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had\\nended, patient in his scythed car.\\n\\nside by side bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with stephen passed\\nthrough the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping\\nover a strand of mire, went across towards gardiner street lower,\\nstephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.\\n\\n_und alle schiffe bruecken._\\n\\nthe driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely\\nwatched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black,\\none full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by\\nfather maher_. as they walked they at times stopped and walked again\\ncontinuing their _tete-a-tete_ (which, of course, he was utterly out\\nof) about sirens enemies of man\\'s reason, mingled with a number of other\\ntopics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind\\nwhile the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the\\nsleeper car who in any case couldn\\'t possibly hear because they were too\\nfar simply sat in his seat near the end of lower gardiner street _and\\nlooked after their lowbacked car_.\\n\\n\\n\\nwhat parallel courses did bloom and stephen follow returning?\\n\\nstarting united both at normal walking pace from beresford place they\\nfollowed in the order named lower and middle gardiner streets and\\nmountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left,\\ngardiner\\'s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of\\ntemple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing\\nright, temple street, north, as far as hardwicke place. approaching,\\ndisparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before\\ngeorge\\'s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than\\nthe arc which it subtends.\\n\\n\\nof what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?\\n\\nmusic, literature, ireland, dublin, paris, friendship, woman,\\nprostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and\\nglowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed\\ncorporation emergency dustbuckets, the roman catholic church,\\necclesiastical celibacy, the irish nation, jesuit education, careers,\\nthe study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the\\npresabbath, stephen\\'s collapse.\\n\\ndid bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective\\nlike and unlike reactions to experience?\\n\\nboth were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to\\nplastic or pictorial. both preferred a continental to an insular manner\\nof life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. both\\nindurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of\\nheterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox\\nreligious, national, social and ethical doctrines. both admitted\\nthe alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual\\nmagnetism.\\n\\n\\nwere their views on some points divergent?\\n\\nstephen dissented openly from bloom\\'s views on the importance of dietary\\nand civic selfhelp while bloom dissented tacitly from stephen\\'s views\\non the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. bloom\\nassented covertly to stephen\\'s rectification of the anachronism\\ninvolved in assigning the date of the conversion of the irish nation to\\nchristianity from druidism by patrick son of calpornus, son of potitus,\\nson of odyssus, sent by pope celestine i in the year 432 in the reign of\\nleary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of cormac macart (died\\n266 a.d.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at sletty\\nand interred at rossnaree. the collapse which bloom ascribed to\\ngastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of\\nadulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and\\nthe velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, stephen\\nattributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both\\nfrom two different points of observation sandycove and dublin) at first\\nno bigger than a woman\\'s hand.\\n\\n\\nwas there one point on which their views were equal and negative?\\n\\nthe influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining\\nparaheliotropic trees.\\n\\n\\nhad bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in\\nthe past?\\n\\nin 1884 with owen goldberg and cecil turnbull at night on public\\nthoroughfares between longwood avenue and leonard\\'s corner and leonard\\'s\\ncorner and synge street and synge street and bloomfield avenue.\\n\\nin 1885 with percy apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall\\nbetween gibraltar villa and bloomfield house in crumlin, barony\\nof uppercross. in 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and\\nprospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class\\nrailway carriages of suburban lines. in 1888 frequently with major brian\\ntweedy and his daughter miss marion tweedy, together and separately on\\nthe lounge in matthew dillon\\'s house in roundtown. once in 1892 and once\\nin 1893 with julius (juda) mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour\\nof his (bloom\\'s) house in lombard street, west.\\n\\n\\nwhat reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885,\\n1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did bloom make before their arrival at\\ntheir destination?\\n\\nhe reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual\\ndevelopment and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction\\nof the converse domain of interindividual relations.\\n\\n\\nas in what ways?\\n\\nfrom inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received:\\nexistence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence\\nto nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.\\n\\nwhat act did bloom make on their arrival at their destination?\\n\\nat the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number\\n7 eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket\\nof his trousers to obtain his latchkey.\\n\\n\\nwas it there?\\n\\nit was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on\\nthe day but one preceding.\\n\\n\\nwhy was he doubly irritated?\\n\\nbecause he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded\\nhimself twice not to forget.\\n\\n\\nwhat were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly\\n(respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?\\n\\nto enter or not to enter. to knock or not to knock.\\n\\n\\nbloom\\'s decision?\\n\\na stratagem. resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the\\narea railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at\\nthe lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its\\nlength of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches\\nof the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by\\nseparating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for\\nthe impact of the fall.\\n\\n\\ndid he fall?\\n\\nby his body\\'s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in\\navoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for\\nperiodical selfweighing in the premises of francis froedman,\\npharmaceutical chemist of 19 frederick street, north, on the last feast\\nof the ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of may of the bissextile year\\none thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era five\\nthousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three\\nhundred and twentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle 9,\\ndominical letters c b, roman indiction 2, julian period 6617, mcmiv.\\n\\n\\ndid he rise uninjured by concussion?\\n\\nregaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by\\nthe impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force\\nat its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied\\nat its fulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the\\nsubadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free\\ninflammable coal gas by turningon the ventcock, lit a high flame which,\\nby regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a\\nportable candle.\\n\\n\\nwhat discrete succession of images did stephen meanwhile perceive?\\n\\nreclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent\\nkitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 cp, a man lighting a\\ncandle of 1 cp, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man\\nleaving the kitchen holding a candle.\\n\\n\\ndid the man reappear elsewhere?\\n\\nafter a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible\\nthrough the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the\\nhalldoor. the halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. in the open space\\nof the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.\\n\\n\\ndid stephen obey his sign?\\n\\nyes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed\\nsoftly along the hallway the man\\'s back and listed feet and lighted\\ncandle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down\\na turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of bloom\\'s\\nhouse.\\n\\n\\nwhat did bloom do?\\n\\nhe extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its\\nflame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for\\nstephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when\\nnecessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid\\nresintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons\\nof best abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of messrs\\nflower and m\\'donald of 14 d\\'olier street, kindled it at three projecting\\npoints of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing\\nthe potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and\\nhydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.\\n\\n\\nof what similar apparitions did stephen think?\\n\\nof others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two,\\nhad kindled fires for him, of brother michael in the infirmary of the\\ncollege of the society of jesus at clongowes wood, sallins, in the\\ncounty of kildare: of his father, simon dedalus, in an unfurnished room\\nof his first residence in dublin, number thirteen fitzgibbon street:\\nof his godmother miss kate morkan in the house of her dying sister miss\\njulia morkan at 15 usher\\'s island: of his aunt sara, wife of richie\\n(richard) goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62

studies, father butt, in the\\nphysics\\' theatre of university college, 16 stephen\\'s green, north: of\\nhis sister dilly (delia) in his father\\'s house in cabra.\\n\\n\\nwhat did stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from\\nthe fire towards the opposite wall?\\n\\nunder a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope,\\nstretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the\\nchimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs\\nfolded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of\\nladies\\' grey hose with lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual\\nposition clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer\\nextremities and the third at their point of junction.\\n\\n\\nwhat did bloom see on the range?\\n\\non the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left\\n(larger) hob a black iron kettle.\\n\\n\\nwhat did bloom do at the range?\\n\\nhe removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron\\nkettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to\\nlet it flow.\\n\\n\\ndid it flow?\\n\\nyes. from roundwood reservoir in county wicklow of a cubic capacity of\\n2400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of\\nfilter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial\\nplant cost of 5 pounds per linear yard by way of the dargle, rathdown,\\nglen of the downs and callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at stillorgan,\\na distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of\\nrelieving tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at\\neustace bridge, upper leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth\\nand daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below\\nthe sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and\\nwaterworks engineer, mr spencer harty, c. e., on the instructions of\\nthe waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for\\npurposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of\\nrecourse being had to the impotable water of the grand and royal canals\\nas in 1893) particularly as the south dublin guardians, notwithstanding\\ntheir ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch\\nmeter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by\\na reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of\\nthe corporation, mr ignatius rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the\\ndetriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers,\\nsolvent, sound.\\n\\nwhat in water did bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier,\\nreturning to the range, admire?\\n\\nits universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature\\nin seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of mercator\\'s\\nprojection: its unplumbed profundity in the sundam trench of the pacific\\nexceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface\\nparticles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence\\nof its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic\\nquiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides:\\nits subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar\\nicecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance:\\nits preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its\\nindisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region\\nbelow the subequatorial tropic of capricorn: the multisecular stability\\nof its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve\\nand hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of\\ntons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and\\nislands, its persistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas\\nand downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and\\nvolume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns:\\nits gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones:\\nits vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and\\nconfluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic\\ncurrents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence\\nin seaquakes, waterspouts, artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies,\\nfreshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers,\\ncataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts:\\nits vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and\\nlatent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments\\nand exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at ashtown\\ngate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its\\ncomposition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part\\nof oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the dead\\nsea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate\\ndams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst\\nand fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and\\nparagon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow,\\nhail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs\\nand bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and\\narchipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and\\narms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility\\nin working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power\\nstations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals,\\nrivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality\\nderivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level\\nto level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe),\\nnumerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its\\nubiquity as constituting 90 percent of the human body: the noxiousness\\nof its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded\\nflowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.\\n\\n\\nhaving set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he\\nreturn to the stillflowing tap?\\n\\nto wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of\\nbarrington\\'s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought\\nthirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh\\ncold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a\\nlong redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.\\n\\n\\nwhat reason did stephen give for declining bloom\\'s offer?\\n\\nthat he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by\\nsubmersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month\\nof october of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of\\nglass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.\\n\\n\\nwhat impeded bloom from giving stephen counsels of hygiene and\\nprophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a\\npreliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with\\nrapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region\\nin case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most\\nsensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?\\n\\nthe incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.\\n\\n\\nwhat additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?\\n\\ndietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric\\nenergy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the\\nlastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.\\n\\n\\nwhich seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?\\n\\nconfidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and\\nrecuperation.\\n\\n\\nwhat concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the\\nagency of fire?\\n\\nthe phenomenon of ebullition. fanned by a constant updraught of\\nventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was\\ncommunicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral\\nmasses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the\\nfoliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn\\nderived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat\\n(radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous\\nether. heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such\\ncombustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source\\nof calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated\\nthrough the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part\\nreflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising\\nthe temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in\\ntemperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal\\nunits needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50 degrees to 212 degrees\\nfahrenheit.\\n\\n\\nwhat announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?\\n\\na double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at\\nboth sides simultaneously.\\n\\n\\nfor what personal purpose could bloom have applied the water so boiled?\\n\\nto shave himself.\\n\\n\\nwhat advantages attended shaving by night?\\n\\na softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from\\nshave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly\\nencountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours:\\nquiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when\\nawaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and\\nperturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman\\'s double knock, a paper\\nread, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a\\nshoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might\\ncause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with\\nprecision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done.\\n\\n\\nwhy did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?\\n\\nbecause of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine\\nfeminine passive active hand.\\n\\n\\nwhat quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting\\ninfluence?\\n\\nthe operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human\\nblood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their\\nnatural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic\\nsurgery.\\n\\n\\nwhat lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the\\nkitchen dresser, opened by bloom?\\n\\non the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal\\nbreakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a\\nmoustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of crown derby, four white\\ngoldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly\\ncopper, and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits. on the middle shelf\\na chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four\\nconglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of\\nplumtree\\'s potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and\\ncontaining one jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of

and\\nsemisolidified curds, which added to the quantity subtracted for mr\\nbloom\\'s and mrs fleming\\'s breakfasts, made one imperial pint, the total\\nquantity originally delivered, two cloves, a halfpenny and a small dish\\ncontaining a slice of fresh ribsteak. on the upper shelf a battery of\\njamjars (empty) of various sizes and proveniences.\\n\\n\\nwhat attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?\\n\\nfour polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets,\\nnumbered 8 87, 88 6.\\n\\n\\nwhat reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?\\n\\nreminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction,\\npreindicative of the result of the gold cup flat handicap, the official\\nand definitive result of which he had read in the _evening telegraph_,\\nlate

(subsequently\\nthrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of\\nthe turkish and warm baths, 11 leinster street, with the light of\\ninspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the\\nsecret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.\\n\\nwhat qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?\\n\\nthe difficulties of interpretation since the

total sum of possible losses proceeding\\noriginally from a successful interpretation.\\n\\n\\nhis mood?\\n\\nhe had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he\\nwas satisfied.\\n\\n\\nwhat satisfied him?\\n\\nto have sustained no positive loss. to have brought a positive gain to\\nothers. light to the gentiles.\\n\\n\\nhow did bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?\\n\\nhe poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of epps\\'s\\nsoluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed\\non the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the\\nprescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity\\nprescribed.\\n\\n\\nwhat supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his\\nguest?\\n\\nrelinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation\\ncrown derby presented to him by his only daughter, millicent (milly),\\nhe substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served\\nextraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the\\nviscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife marion\\n(molly).\\n\\n\\nwas the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of\\nhospitality?\\n\\nhis attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he accepted\\nthem seriously as they drank in jocoserious

of stephen\\'s present age stephen\\nwas 6. 16 years after in 1920 when stephen would be of bloom\\'s present\\nage bloom would be 54. in 1936 when bloom would be 70 and stephen 54\\ntheir ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13\\n1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according\\nas arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in\\n1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then\\n1904 when stephen was 22 bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when stephen\\nwould be 38, as bloom then was, bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when\\nstephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 bloom,\\nbeing 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have\\nsurpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of methusalah,\\n969 years, while, if stephen would continue to live until he would\\nattain that age in the year 3072 a.d., bloom would have been obliged to\\nhave been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have been born in\\nthe year 81,396 b.c.\\n\\n\\nwhat events might nullify these calculations?\\n\\nthe cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a\\nnew era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent\\nextermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.\\n\\n\\nhow many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?\\n\\ntwo. the first in the lilacgarden of matthew dillon\\'s house, medina\\nvilla, kimmage road, roundtown, in 1887, in the company of stephen\\'s\\nmother, stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his\\nhand in salutation. the second in the coffeeroom of breslin\\'s hotel on a\\nrainy sunday in the january of 1892, in the company of stephen\\'s father\\nand stephen\\'s granduncle, stephen being then 5 years older.\\n\\n\\ndid bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and\\nafterwards seconded by the father?\\n\\nvery gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative\\ngratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.\\n\\n\\ndid their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a\\nthird connecting link between them?\\n\\nmrs riordan (dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the\\nhouse of stephen\\'s parents from 1 september 1888 to 29 december 1891 and\\nhad also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the city arms\\nhotel owned by elizabeth o\\'dowd of 54 prussia street where, during parts\\nof the years 1893 and 1894, she had been a constant informant of bloom\\nwho resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the\\nemployment of joseph cuffe of 5 smithfield for the superintendence of\\nsales in the adjacent dublin cattle market on the north circular road.\\n\\n\\nhad he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?\\n\\nhe had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow\\nof independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair\\nwith slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the north\\ncircular road opposite mr gavin low\\'s place of business where she had\\nremained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular\\nfieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles\\nequipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems,\\nprivate and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from\\nthe city to the phoenix park and vice versa.\\n\\n\\nwhy could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?\\n\\nbecause in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel\\nof bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with\\ncontinual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds,\\nvelocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round\\nand round the rim of a round and round precipitous

of the 27 june 1886, at some hour unstated,\\nin consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in\\nthe form of a neuralgic liniment composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment\\nto i of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m. on the\\nmorning of 27 june 1886 at the medical hall of francis dennehy, 17\\nchurch street, ennis) after having, though not in consequence of

inclined him\\nin favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?\\n\\nin disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper\\nwith signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were greek and irish and\\nhebrew characters. she had interrogated constantly at varying intervals\\nas to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of\\na city in canada, quebec. she understood little of political\\ncomplications, internal, or balance of power, external. in calculating\\nthe addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid.\\nafter completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned\\nthe implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to\\nthe corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall. unusual\\npolysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false\\nanalogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), _alias_ (a\\nmendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).\\n\\n\\nwhat compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and\\nsuch deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?\\n\\nthe false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all\\nbalances, proved true by construction. the counterbalance of her\\nproficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.\\n\\n\\nhow had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?\\n\\nvariously. by leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a\\ncertain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent\\nknowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other\\'s\\nignorant lapse.\\n\\n\\nwith what success had he attempted direct instruction?\\n\\nshe followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest\\ncomprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty\\nremembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated\\nwith error.\\n\\n\\nwhat system had proved more effective?\\n\\nindirect suggestion implicating selfinterest.\\n\\n\\nexample?\\n\\nshe disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she\\ndisliked new hat with rain, he liked woman

adduce?\\n\\nthree seekers of the pure truth, moses of egypt, moses maimonides,\\nauthor of _more nebukim_ (guide of the perplexed) and moses mendelssohn\\nof such eminence that from moses (of egypt) to moses (mendelssohn) there\\narose none like moses (maimonides).\\n\\n\\nwhat statement was made, under correction, by bloom concerning a fourth\\nseeker of pure truth, by name aristotle, mentioned,

fragments of verse from the ancient hebrew and ancient irish\\nlanguages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts\\nby guest to host and by host to guest?\\n\\nby stephen: _suil,

temple\\namid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).\\n\\n\\nhow was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages\\nmade in substantiation of the oral comparison?\\n\\nby juxtaposition. on the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior\\nliterary style, entituled _sweets of sin_ (produced by bloom and so\\nmanipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of\\nthe table) with a pencil (supplied by stephen) stephen wrote the irish\\ncharacters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and bloom in turn\\nwrote the hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of\\nmem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal\\nand cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1, 4, and 100.\\n\\n\\nwas the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the\\nextinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?\\n\\ntheoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence\\nand syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.\\n\\n\\nwhat points of contact existed between these languages and between the\\npeoples who spoke them?\\n\\nthe presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and\\nservile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been\\ntaught on the plain of shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary\\ninstituted by fenius farsaigh, descendant of noah, progenitor of israel,\\nand ascendant of heber and heremon, progenitors of ireland: their\\narchaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homiletic,\\ntoponomastic, historical and

kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the\\nisolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (s.\\nmary\\'s abbey) and masshouse (adam and eve\\'s tavern): the proscription\\nof their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts: the\\nrestoration in chanah david of zion and the possibility of irish\\npolitical autonomy or devolution.\\n\\n\\nwhat

arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?\\n\\nin consequence of defective mnemotechnic.\\n\\n\\nhow did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?\\n\\nby a periphrastic version of the general text.\\n\\n\\nin what common study did their mutual reflections merge?\\n\\nthe increasing simplification traceable from the egyptian epigraphic\\nhieroglyphs to the greek and roman alphabets and the anticipation of\\nmodern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions\\n(semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (celtic). did\\nthe guest comply with his host\\'s request?\\n\\ndoubly, by appending his signature in irish and roman characters.\\n\\nwhat was stephen\\'s auditive sensation?\\n\\nhe heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation\\nof the past.\\n\\n\\nwhat was bloom\\'s visual sensation?\\n\\nhe saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a\\nfuture.\\n\\n\\nwhat were stephen\\'s and bloom\\'s quasisimultaneous volitional\\nquasisensations of concealed identities?\\n\\nvisually, stephen\\'s: the traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted\\nby johannes damascenus, lentulus romanus and epiphanius monachus as\\nleucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair. auditively, bloom\\'s: the\\ntraditional accent of the ecstasy of catastrophe.\\n\\n\\nwhat future careers had been possible for bloom in the past and with\\nwhat exemplars?\\n\\nin the church, roman, anglican or nonconformist: exemplars, the very\\nreverend john conmee s. j., the reverend t. salmon, d. d., provost of\\ntrinity college, dr alexander j. dowie. at the bar, english or irish:\\nexemplars, seymour bushe, k. c., rufus isaacs, k. c. on the stage modern\\nor shakespearean: exemplars, charles wyndham, high comedian osmond\\ntearle (died 1901), exponent of shakespeare.\\n\\n\\ndid the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange\\nlegend on an allied theme?\\n\\nreassuringly,

cocoa, having been consumed.\\n\\n\\nrecite the first (major) part of this chanted legend.\\n\\n     _little harry hughes and his schoolfellows all\\n     went out for to play ball.\\n     and the

him by the lilywhite hand\\n     and led him along the hall\\n     until she led him to a room\\n     where none could hear him call.\\n\\n     she took a penknife out of her pocket\\n     and cut off his little head.\\n     and now he\\'ll play his ball no more\\n     for he lies among the dead._\\n\\n\\nhow did the father of millicent receive this second part?\\n\\nwith mixed feelings. unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew\\'s\\ndaughter, all dressed in green.\\n\\n\\ncondense stephen\\'s commentary.\\n\\none of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. once by\\ninadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny. it comes when he\\nis abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope\\nand youth, holds him unresisting. it leads him to a strange habitation,\\nto a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him,\\nconsenting.\\n\\n\\nwhy was the host (victim predestined) sad?\\n\\nhe wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him\\nshould by him not be told.\\n\\n\\nwhy was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?\\n\\nin accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.\\n\\n\\nwhy was the host (secret infidel) silent?\\n\\nhe weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the\\nincitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the\\npropagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of\\nopulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of\\natavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism,\\nhypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.\\n\\n\\nfrom which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not\\ntotally immune?\\n\\nfrom hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his\\nsleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an\\nindefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. from\\nsomnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and\\ncrawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained\\nits destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain,\\nsleeping.\\n\\n\\nhad this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member\\nof his family?\\n\\ntwice, in holles street and in ontario terrace, his daughter millicent\\n(milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation\\nof terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night\\nattire with a vacant mute expression.\\n\\n\\nwhat other infantile memories had he of her?\\n\\n15 june 1889. a querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and\\nlessen congestion. a child renamed padney socks she shook with shocks\\nher moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo,\\ntlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark,\\nshe had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, herr hauptmann hainau,\\naustrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant mulvey, british\\nnavy.\\n\\n\\nwhat endemic characteristics were present?\\n\\nconversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct\\nline of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant\\nintervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.\\n\\n\\nwhat memories had he of her adolescence?\\n\\nshe relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. on the duke\\'s lawn,\\nentreated by an english visitor, she declined to permit him to make and\\ntake away her photographic image (objection not stated). on the south\\ncircular road in the company of elsa potter, followed by an individual\\nof sinister aspect, she went half way down stamer street and turned\\nabruptly back (reason of change not stated). on the vigil of the 15th\\nanniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from mullingar, county\\nwestmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year\\nnot stated).\\n\\n\\ndid that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?\\n\\nless than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.\\n\\n\\nwhat second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly,\\nif differently?\\n\\na temporary departure of his cat.\\n\\n\\nwhy similarly, why differently?\\n\\nsimilarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male\\n\\n(mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). differently,\\nbecause of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the\\nhabitation.\\n\\n\\nin other respects were their differences similar?\\n\\nin passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in\\nunexpectedness.\\n\\n\\nas?\\n\\ninasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it\\nfor her (cf neckarching cat). moreover, on the free surface of the lake\\nin stephen\\'s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented\\nspit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the\\nconstancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf\\nmousewatching cat).\\n\\nagain, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences\\nof a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf\\nearwashing cat). furthermore, silly milly, she dreamed of having had\\nan unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been\\njoseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which\\nit (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf hearthdreaming cat). hence, in\\npassivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness,\\ntheir differences were similar.\\n\\n\\nin what way had he utilised gifts (1) an owl, (2) a clock, given as\\nmatrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?\\n\\nas object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous\\nanimals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of\\nvision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the\\npendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation\\nin terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of\\nclockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the\\nrecurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the\\nshorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, _videlicet_, 5\\n5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.\\n\\n\\nin what manners did she reciprocate?\\n\\nshe remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to\\nhim a breakfast moustachecup of imitation crown derby porcelain ware.\\nshe provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases\\nhad been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his\\nnecessities, anticipating his desires. she admired: a natural phenomenon\\nhaving been explained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire\\nto possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the\\nmoiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.\\n\\n\\nwhat proposal did bloom, diambulist, father of milly, somnambulist, make\\nto stephen, noctambulist?\\n\\nto pass in repose the hours intervening between thursday (proper) and\\nfriday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately\\nabove the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of\\nhis host and hostess.\\n\\n\\nwhat various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation\\nof such an extemporisation?\\n\\nfor the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. for the\\nhost: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. for the\\nhostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct italian\\npronunciation.\\n\\n\\nwhy might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and\\na hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent\\neventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew\\'s\\ndaughter?\\n\\nbecause the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother\\nthrough daughter.\\n\\n\\nto what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest\\nreturn a monosyllabic negative answer?\\n\\nif he had known the late mrs emily sinico, accidentally killed at sydney\\nparade railway station, 14 october 1903.\\n\\n\\nwhat inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the\\nhost?\\n\\na statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment\\nof mrs mary dedalus (born goulding), 26 june 1903, vigil of the\\nanniversary of the decease of rudolph bloom (born virag).\\n\\n\\nwas the proposal of asylum accepted?\\n\\npromptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.\\nwhat exchange of money took place between host and guest?\\n\\nthe former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money\\n(1-7-0), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to\\nthe former.\\n\\n\\nwhat counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified,\\ndeclined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?\\n\\nto inaugurate a prearranged course of italian instruction, place\\nthe residence of the instructed. to inaugurate a course of vocal\\ninstruction, place the residence of the instructress. to inaugurate\\na series of static semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues,\\nplaces the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in\\nthe same place), the ship hotel and tavern, 6 lower abbey street (w. and\\ne. connery, proprietors), the national library of ireland, 10 kildare\\nstreet, the national maternity hospital, 29, 30 and 31 holles street, a\\npublic garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two\\nor more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line\\ndrawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in\\ndifferent places).\\n\\n\\nwhat rendered problematic for bloom the realisation of these mutually\\nselfexcluding propositions?\\n\\nthe irreparability of the past: once at a performance of albert\\nhengler\\'s circus in the rotunda, rutland square, dublin, an intuitive\\nparticoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring\\nto a place in the auditorium where bloom, solitary, was seated and had\\npublicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (bloom) was his\\n(the clown\\'s) papa. the imprevidibility of the future: once in the\\nsummer of 1898 he (bloom) had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches\\non the milled edge and tendered it m payment of an account due to and\\nreceived by j. and t. davy, family grocers, 1 charlemont mall, grand\\ncanal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible,\\ncircuitous or direct, return.\\n\\n\\nwas the clown bloom\\'s son?\\n\\nno.\\n\\n\\nhad bloom\\'s coin returned?\\n\\nnever.\\n\\n\\nwhy would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?\\n\\nbecause at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to\\namend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and\\ninternational animosity. he believed then that human life was infinitely\\nperfectible, eliminating these conditions?\\n\\nthere remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct\\nfrom human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of\\ndestruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of\\nthe ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and\\ndeath: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human\\nfemales extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable\\naccidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies\\nand their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital\\ncriminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make\\nterror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres\\nof which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital\\ngrowth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through\\nmaturity to decay.\\n\\n\\nwhy did he desist from speculation?\\n\\nbecause it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other\\nmore acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena\\nto be removed.\\n\\n\\ndid stephen participate in his dejection?\\n\\nhe affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding\\nsyllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational\\nreagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the\\nincertitude of the void.\\n\\n\\nwas this affirmation apprehended by bloom?\\n\\nnot verbally. substantially.\\n\\n\\nwhat comforted his misapprehension?\\n\\nthat as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from\\nthe unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.\\n\\n\\nin what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus\\nfrom the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?\\n\\nlighted candle in stick borne by\\n\\nbloom\\n\\ndiaconal hat on ashplant borne by\\n\\nstephen:\\n\\n\\nwith what intonation secreto of what commemorative psalm?\\n\\nthe 113th, _modus peregrinus: in exitu israel de egypto: domus jacob de\\npopulo barbaro_.\\n\\n\\nwhat did each do at the door of egress?\\n\\nbloom set the candlestick on the floor. stephen put the hat on his head.\\n\\n\\nfor what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?\\n\\nfor a cat.\\n\\n\\nwhat spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the\\nguest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from\\nthe rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?\\n\\nthe heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.\\n\\n\\nwith what meditations did bloom accompany his demonstration to his\\ncompanion of various constellations?\\n\\nmeditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in\\nincipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous\\nscintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an\\nobserver placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000\\nft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of sirius\\n(alpha in canis maior) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles) distant\\nand in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of arcturus: of the\\nprecession of equinoxes: of orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and\\nnebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund\\nand of nascent new stars such as nova in 1901: of our system plunging\\ntowards the constellation of hercules: of the parallax or parallactic\\ndrift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from\\nimmeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with\\nwhich the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a\\nparenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.\\n\\n\\nwere there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?\\n\\nof the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the\\nearth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed\\nin cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds,\\nof microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable\\ntrillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained\\nby cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe\\nof human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves\\nuniverses of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in\\ncontinuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was\\nagain divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends\\nand divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the\\nprogress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.\\n\\n\\nwhy did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?\\n\\nbecause some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem\\nof the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a\\nnumber computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude\\nand of so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that,\\nthe result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000\\npages each of innumerable quires and reams of india paper would have to\\nbe requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed\\nintegers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands,\\nhundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions,\\nbillions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series\\ncontaining succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost\\nkinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.\\n\\n\\ndid he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their\\nsatellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and\\nmoral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?\\n\\nof a different order of difficulty. conscious that the human organism,\\nnormally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons,\\nwhen elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere\\nsuffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as\\nthe line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was\\napproximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo,\\nwhen proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a\\nworking hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more\\nadaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might\\nsubsist otherwise under martian, mercurial, veneral, jovian, saturnian,\\nneptunian or uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though\\nan apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite\\ndifferences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would\\nprobably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to\\nvanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.\\n\\n     and the problem of possible redemption?\\n     the minor was proved by the major.\\n\\n\\nwhich various features of the constellations were in turn considered?\\n\\nthe various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white,\\nyellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy:\\ntheir magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions:\\nthe waggoner\\'s star: walsingham way: the chariot of david: the annular\\ncinctures of saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the\\ninterdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous\\ndiscoveries of galileo, simon marius, piazzi, le verrier, herschel,\\ngalle: the systematisations attempted by bode and kepler of cubes\\nof distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite\\ncompressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive\\nand reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of\\nmeteoric stones: the libyan floods on mars about the period of the birth\\nof the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers\\nabout the period of the feast of s. lawrence (martyr, lo august): the\\nmonthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms:\\nthe posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a\\nstar (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and\\nday (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in\\nincandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the\\nbirth of william shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting\\nconstellation of cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude) of similar\\norigin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared\\nfrom the constellation of the corona septentrionalis about the period\\nof the birth of leopold bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar\\norigin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared\\nfrom the constellation of andromeda about the period of the birth of\\nstephen dedalus, and in and from the constellation of auriga some years\\nafter the birth and death of rudolph bloom, junior, and in and from\\nother constellations some years before or after the birth or death of\\nother persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar,\\nfrom immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow,\\ntaciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular\\nanimals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters,\\npallor of human beings.\\n\\n\\nhis (bloom\\'s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing\\nfor possible error?\\n\\nthat it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not\\na heavenman. that it was a utopia, there being no known method from\\nthe known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the\\nsuppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of\\ndifferent magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space,\\nremobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a\\npresent before its probable spectators had entered actual present\\nexistence.\\n\\n\\nwas he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?\\n\\nindubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the\\ndelirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection\\ninvoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the\\nsatellite of their planet.\\n\\n\\ndid he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological\\ninfluences upon sublunary disasters?\\n\\nit seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the\\nnomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to\\nverifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the\\nsea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.\\n\\n\\nwhat special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and\\nwoman?\\n\\nher antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian\\ngenerations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence:\\nher luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising\\nand setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced\\ninvariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative\\ninterrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power\\nto enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to\\nincite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her\\nvisage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent\\npropinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her\\nlight, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her\\narid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction,\\nwhen invisible.\\n\\n\\nwhat visible luminous sign attracted bloom\\'s, who attracted stephen\\'s,\\ngaze?\\n\\nin the second storey (rere) of his (bloom\\'s) house the light of a\\nparaffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller\\nblind supplied by frank o\\'hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving\\nshutter manufacturer, 16 aungier street.\\n\\n\\nhow did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his\\nwife marion (molly) bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?\\n\\nwith indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued\\naffection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with\\nsuggestion.\\n\\n\\nboth then were silent?\\n\\nsilent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal\\nflesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.\\n\\n\\nwere they indefinitely inactive?\\n\\nat stephen\\'s suggestion, at bloom\\'s instigation both, first stephen,\\nthen bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs\\nof micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition,\\ntheir gazes, first bloom\\'s, then stephen\\'s, elevated to the projected\\nluminous and semiluminous shadow.\\n\\n\\nsimilarly?\\n\\nthe trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations\\nwere dissimilar: bloom\\'s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of\\nthe bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate\\nyear at high school (1880) had been capable of attaining the point\\nof greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the\\ninstitution, 210 scholars: stephen\\'s higher, more sibilant, who in the\\nultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption\\nan insistent vesical pressure.\\n\\n\\nwhat different problems presented themselves to each concerning the\\ninvisible audible collateral organ of the other?\\n\\nto bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity,\\nreactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.\\n\\nto stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of jesus circumcised\\n(i january, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from\\nunnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine\\nprepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy roman catholic apostolic\\nchurch, conserved in calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of\\nthe fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine\\nexcrescences as hair and toenails.\\n\\n\\nwhat celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?\\n\\na star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament\\nfrom vega in the lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the tress\\nof berenice towards the zodiacal sign of leo.\\n\\n\\nhow did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal\\ndeparter?\\n\\nby inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an\\nunstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and\\nturning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its\\nstaple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and\\nrevealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.\\n\\n\\nhow did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?\\n\\nstanding perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its\\nbase, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and\\nforming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.\\n\\n\\nwhat sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their\\n(respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?\\n\\nthe sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells\\nin the church of saint george.\\n\\n\\nwhat echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?\\n\\nby stephen:\\n\\n_liliata rutilantium. turma circumdet. iubilantium te virginum. chorus\\nexcipiat._\\n\\nby bloom:\\n\\n     _heigho, heigho,\\n     heigho, heigho._\\n\\n\\nwhere were the several members of the company which with bloom that day\\nat the bidding of that peal had travelled from sandymount in the south\\nto glasnevin in the north?\\n\\nmartin cunningham (in bed), jack power (in bed), simon dedalus (in bed),\\nned lambert (in bed), tom kernan (in bed), joe hynes (in bed), john\\nhenry menton (in bed), bernard corrigan (in bed), patsy dignam (in bed),\\npaddy dignam (in the grave).\\n\\n\\nalone, what did bloom hear?\\n\\nthe double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the\\ndouble vibration of a jew\\'s harp in the resonant lane.\\n\\n\\nalone, what did bloom feel?\\n\\nthe cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing\\npoint or the absolute zero of fahrenheit, centigrade or reaumur: the\\nincipient intimations of proximate dawn.\\n\\n\\nof what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind\\nhim?\\n\\nof companions now in various manners in different places defunct: percy\\napjohn (killed in action, modder river), philip gilligan (phthisis,\\njervis street hospital), matthew f. kane (accidental drowning, dublin\\nbay), philip moisel (pyemia, heytesbury street), michael hart (phthisis,\\nmater misericordiae hospital), patrick dignam (apoplexy, sandymount).\\n\\n\\nwhat prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?\\n\\nthe disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the\\napparition of a new solar disk.\\n\\n\\nhad he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?\\n\\nonce, in 1887, after a protracted performance of charades in the house\\nof luke doyle, kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition\\nof the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the\\ndirection of mizrach, the east.\\n\\n\\nhe remembered the initial paraphenomena?\\n\\nmore active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at\\nvarious points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer,\\nthe visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the\\nfirst golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.\\n\\n\\ndid he remain?\\n\\nwith deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering\\nthe passage, reclosing the door. with brief suspiration he reassumed the\\ncandle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room,\\nhallfloor, and reentered.\\n\\n\\nwhat suddenly arrested his ingress?\\n\\nthe right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into\\ncontact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible\\nfraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in\\nconsequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.\\n\\n\\ndescribe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of\\nfurniture.\\n\\na sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite\\nthe door to the ingleside near the compactly furled union jack (an\\nalteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and\\nwhite checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the\\ndoor in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard\\n(a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had\\nbeen moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but\\nmore perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved\\nfrom right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied\\nby the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.\\n\\n\\ndescribe them.\\n\\none: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back\\nslanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an\\nirregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply\\nupholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration.\\nthe other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed\\ndirectly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat\\nto base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of\\nwhite plaited rush.\\n\\n\\nwhat significances attached to these two chairs?\\n\\nsignificances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial\\nevidence, of testimonial supermanence.\\n\\n\\nwhat occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?\\n\\na vertical piano (cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin\\nsupporting a pair of long yellow ladies\\' gloves and an emerald ashtray\\ncontaining four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two\\ndiscoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in\\nthe key of g natural for voice and piano of _love\\'s old sweet song_\\n(words by g. clifton bingham, composed by j. l. molloy, sung by madam\\nantoinette sterling) open at the last page with the final indications\\n_ad libitum, forte_, pedal, _animato_, sustained pedal, _ritirando_,\\nclose.\\n\\n\\nwith what sensations did bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?\\n\\nwith strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right\\ntemple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on\\na large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation,\\nbending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement,\\nremembering dr malachi mulligan\\'s scheme of colour containing the\\ngradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent\\nact and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility\\nthe consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual\\ndiscolouration.\\n\\n\\nhis next proceeding?\\n\\nfrom an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black\\ndiminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on\\na small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the\\nmantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus\\n(illustrated) entitled agendath netaim, unfolded the same, examined\\nit superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the\\ncandleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the\\nlatter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin\\nof the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to\\nfacilitate total combustion.\\n\\n\\nwhat followed this operation?\\n\\nthe truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a\\nvertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.\\n\\n\\nwhat homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the\\nmantelpiece?\\n\\na timepiece of striated connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46\\na.m. on the 21 march 1896, matrimonial gift of matthew dillon: a dwarf\\ntree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial\\ngift of luke and caroline doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of\\nalderman john hooper.\\n\\n\\nwhat interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and\\nbloom?\\n\\nin the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the\\ndwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. before\\nthe mirror the matrimonial gift of alderman john hooper with a clear\\nmelancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded bloom\\nwhile bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated\\ngaze regarded the matrimonial gift of luke and caroline doyle.\\n\\n\\nwhat composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his\\nattention?\\n\\nthe image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.\\n\\n\\nwhy solitary (ipsorelative)?\\n\\n_brothers and sisters had he none. yet that man\\'s father was his\\ngrandfather\\'s son._\\n\\n\\nwhy mutable (aliorelative)?\\n\\nfrom infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix.\\nfrom maturity to senility he would increasingly

bounder), corporal proportion (a\\nbillsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a\\nboaster).\\n\\n\\nwhy for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal\\nproportion and commercial ability?\\n\\nbecause he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding\\nmembers of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably\\ntransmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with\\ndesire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene\\ncomprehension and apprehension.\\n\\n\\nwith what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections\\naffected?\\n\\nenvy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.\\n\\n\\nenvy?\\n\\nof a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the\\nsuperincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic\\npiston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of\\na constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental\\nfemale organism, passive but not obtuse.\\n\\n\\njealousy?\\n\\nbecause a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately\\nthe agent and reagent of attraction. because attraction between agent(s)\\nand reagent(s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of\\nincrease and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial\\nreentrance. because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of\\nattraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.\\n\\n\\nabnegation?\\n\\nin virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in september 1903 in the\\nestablishment of george mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 eden\\nquay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and\\nreappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of\\nambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d)\\nextraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative,\\ne) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current

accordance\\nwith his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity.\\nas not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in\\nconsequence of a collision with a dark sun. as less reprehensible than\\ntheft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money\\nunder false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public\\nmoney, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of\\nminors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason,\\nfelony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking,\\npractice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field,\\nperjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king\\'s enemies,\\nimpersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated\\nmurder. as not more abnormal than all other parallel processes of\\nadaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal\\nequilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances,\\nfoods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant\\ndisease. as more than inevitable, irreparable.\\n\\n\\nwhy more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?\\n\\nfrom outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but\\noutrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially\\nviolated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the\\nadulterously violated.\\n\\n\\nwhat retribution, if any?\\n\\nassassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. duel by\\ncombat, no. divorce, not now. exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic\\nbed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not yet. suit\\nfor damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of\\ninjuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly. hushmoney by moral\\ninfluence possibly. if any, positively, connivance, introduction of\\nemulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral,\\na successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation,\\nhumiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other,\\nprotecting the separator from both.\\n\\n\\nby what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of\\nincertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?\\n\\nthe preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility\\nof the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between\\nthe selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the\\nselfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done; the fallaciously inferred\\ndebility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the variations of\\nethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving\\nno alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as\\nmasculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct\\nfeminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist\\npreterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb\\nand quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary\\nmasculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of\\nseminators by generation: the continual production of semen by\\ndistillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the\\ninanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy\\nof the stars.\\n\\n\\nin what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and\\nreflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?\\n\\nsatisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial\\nhemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored\\n(the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of\\ngreece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female\\nhemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and\\nseminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude,\\ninsusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression,\\nexpressive of mute immutable mature animality.\\n\\n\\nthe visible signs of antesatisfaction?\\n\\nan approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a\\ntentative revelation: a silent contemplation.\\n\\n\\nthen?\\n\\nhe kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each\\nplump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure\\nprolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.\\n\\n\\nthe visible signs of postsatisfaction?\\n\\na silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a\\nsolicitous aversion: a proximate erection.\\n\\n\\nwhat followed this silent action?\\n\\nsomnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation,\\ncatechetical interrogation.\\n\\n\\nwith what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?\\n\\nnegative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between\\nmartha clifford and henry flower, the public altercation at, in and\\nin the vicinity of the licensed premises of bernard kiernan and co,\\nlimited, 8, 9 and 10 little britain street, the erotic provocation\\nand response thereto caused by the exhibitionism of gertrude (gerty),\\nsurname unknown. positive: he included mention of a performance by mrs\\nbandmann palmer of leah at the gaiety theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 south king\\nstreet, an invitation to supper at wynn\\'s (murphy\\'s) hotel, 35, 36 and\\n37 lower abbey street, a volume of peccaminous pornographical

modifications?\\n\\nabsolutely.\\n\\n\\nwhich event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?\\n\\nstephen dedalus, professor and author.\\n\\n\\nwhat limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were\\nperceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the\\ncourse of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?\\n\\nby the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been\\ncelebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8\\nseptember 1870), viz. 8 october, and consummated on the same date with\\nfemale issue born 15 june 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated\\non the lo september of the same year and complete carnal intercourse,\\nwith ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last\\ntaken place 5 weeks previous, viz. 27 november 1893, to the birth on 29\\ndecember 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 january 1894,\\naged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days\\nduring which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation\\nof semen within the natural female organ. by the narrator a limitation\\nof activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental\\nintercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since\\nthe consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the\\nfemale issue of narrator and listener, 15 september 1903, there remained\\na period of 9 months and 1 day during which, in consequence of a\\npreestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the\\nconsummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of\\naction had been circumscribed.\\n\\n\\nhow?\\n\\nby various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine\\ndestination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration\\nfor which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences,\\nprojected or effected.\\n\\n\\nwhat moved visibly above the listener\\'s and the narrator\\'s invisible\\nthoughts?\\n\\nthe upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of\\nconcentric circles of

his\\nbreakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _city arms_ hotel\\nwhen he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his\\nhighness to make himself interesting for that old faggot mrs riordan\\nthat he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing\\nall for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually\\nafraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her\\nailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes\\nand the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first god help the\\nworld if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks\\nof course nobody wanted her to wear them i suppose she was pious because\\nno man would look at her twice i hope ill never be like her a wonder\\nshe didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman\\ncertainly and her gabby talk about mr riordan here and mr riordan there\\ni suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and\\nalways edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still i like\\nthat in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too\\nhes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything\\nreally serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into\\na hospital where everything is clean but i suppose id have to dring it\\ninto him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing\\non the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun\\nmaybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as im not yes\\nbecause theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman\\nto get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was o tragic and that\\ndyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at\\nthe choir party at the sugarloaf mountain the day i wore that dress\\nmiss stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the\\nbottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with\\nher old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to\\nnever see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard\\na bit grown in the bed father was the same besides i hate bandaging and\\ndosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed\\nget bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing i was sick then wed see what\\nattention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble\\nthey do yes he came somewhere im sure by his appetite anyway love its\\nnot or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those\\nnight women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he\\nmade up a pack of lies to hide it planning it hynes kept me who did i\\nmeet ah yes i met do you remember menton and who else who let me see\\nthat big babbyface i saw him and he not long married flirting with a\\nyoung girl at pooles myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked\\nout looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make\\nup to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of\\nall the big stupoes i ever met and thats called a solicitor only for\\ni hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some\\nlittle bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the\\nsly if they only knew him as well as i do yes because the day before\\nyesterday he was scribbling something a letter when i came into the\\nfront room to show him dignams death in the paper as if something told\\nme and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking\\nabout business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks\\nshe has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age\\nespecially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she\\ncan out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my\\nbottom was to hide it not that i care two straws now who he does it with\\nor knew before that way though id like to find out so long as i dont\\nhave the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that mary\\nwe had in ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad\\nenough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice\\ni had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when i found the\\nlong hair on his coat without that one when i went into the kitchen\\npretending he was drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was\\nall his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could\\neat at our table on christmas day if you please o no thank you not in my\\nhouse stealing my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see\\nher aunt if you please common robbery so it was but i was sure he had\\nsomething on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he\\nsaid you have no proof it was her proof o yes her aunt was very fond of\\noysters but i told her what i thought of her suggesting me to go out to\\nbe alone with her i wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters i\\nfound in her room the friday she was out that was enough for me a little\\nbit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when i gave her her\\nweeks notice i saw to that better do without them altogether do out the\\nrooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt\\ni gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house i couldnt even\\ntouch him if i thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven\\nlike that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in\\nthe w c too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt\\npossibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last\\ntime he came on my bottom when was it the night boylan gave my hand a\\ngreat squeeze going along by the tolka in my hand there steals another\\ni just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back\\nsinging the young may moon shes beaming love because he has an idea\\nabout him and me hes not such a fool he said im dining out and going to\\nthe gaiety though im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case\\ngod knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the\\nsame old hat unless i paid some nicelooking boy to do it since i cant do\\nit myself a young boy would like me id confuse him a little alone with\\nhim if we were id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn\\nred looking at him seduce him i know what boys feel with that down\\non their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour\\nquestion and answer would you do this that and the other with the\\ncoalman yes with a bishop yes i would because i told him about some dean\\nor bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when i was\\nknitting that woollen thing a stranger to dublin what place was it and\\nso on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging\\nhim making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are\\nyou thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german\\nemperor is it yes imagine im him think of him can you feel him trying to\\nmake a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this\\nage of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it\\npretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway\\nand it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with\\nall the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time\\nafter that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why\\ncant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes\\nlove to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help\\nyourself i wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there\\nand kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to\\nyour soul almost paralyses you then i hate that confession when i used\\nto go to father corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did\\nwhere and i said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your\\nperson my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was\\nit where you sit down yes o lord couldnt he say bottom right out and\\nhave done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever\\nway he put it i forget no father and i always think of the real father\\nwhat did he want to know for when i already confessed it to god he had\\na nice fat hand the palm moist always i wouldnt mind feeling it neither\\nwould he id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar i wonder did he know\\nme in the box i could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed\\nnever turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre\\nlost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone\\nthem id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of\\nincense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if\\nyoure married hes too careful about himself then give something to h\\nh the pope for a penance i wonder was he satisfied with me one thing i\\ndidnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall\\nthough i laughed im not a horse or an ass am i i suppose he was thinking\\nof his fathers i wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am i in\\nit who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of\\ndrink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick\\ntheir bills up with some liqueur id like to sip those richlooking green\\nand yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the\\nopera hats i tasted once with my finger dipped out of that american that\\nhad the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to\\nkeep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the\\nport and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because i felt lovely\\nand tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment i popped\\nstraight into bed till that thunder woke me up god be merciful to us\\ni thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when i\\nblessed myself and said a hail mary like those awful thunderbolts in\\ngibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and\\ntell you theres no god what could you do if it was running and rushing\\nabout nothing only make an act of contrition the candle i lit that\\nevening in whitefriars street chapel for the month of may see it brought\\nits luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church\\nmass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey\\nmatter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when i lit the\\nlamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red\\nbrute of a thing he has i thought the vein or whatever the dickens they\\ncall it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after i took\\noff all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and\\nperfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar\\nstanding all the time he must have eaten oysters i think a few dozen he\\nwas in great singing voice no i never in all my life felt anyone had\\none the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole\\nsheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the\\nmiddle of us or like a stallion driving it up into you because thats all\\nthey want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye i had\\nto halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in\\nhim when i made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is\\nso much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last\\ntime i let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for\\nhim to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it\\nthemselves theyd know what i went through with milly nobody would\\nbelieve cutting her teeth too and mina purefoys husband give us a swing\\nout of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year\\nas regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one\\nthey called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on\\nit jesusjack the child is a black the last time i was there a squad of\\nthem falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears\\nsupposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like\\nelephants or i dont know what supposing i risked having another not off\\nhim though still if he was married im sure hed have a fine strong child\\nbut i dont know poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly\\ni suppose it was meeting josie powell and the funeral and thinking about\\nme and boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll\\ndo him any good i know they were spooning a bit when i came on the scene\\nhe was dancing and sitting out with her the night of georgina simpsons\\nhousewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account\\nof not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup\\nrow over politics he began it not me when he said about our lord being a\\ncarpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about\\neverything i was fuming with myself after for giving in only for i knew\\nhe was gone on me and the first socialist he said he was he annoyed me\\nso much i couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup\\nthings especially about the body and the inside i often wanted to study\\nup that myself what we have inside us in that family physician i could\\nalways hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him\\nafter that i pretended i had a coolness on with her over him because he\\nused to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going\\nto and i said over to floey and he made me the present of byron\\'s poems\\nand the three pairs of gloves so that finished that i could quite easily\\nget him to make it up any time i know how id even supposing he got in\\nwith her again and was going out to see her somewhere id know if he\\nrefused to eat the onions i know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the\\ncollar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out i\\nkiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let\\nhim go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes\\nmad in love with him that i wouldnt so much mind id just go to her and\\nask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool\\nme but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his\\nplabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though i had the devils own\\njob to get it out of him though i liked him for that it showed he could\\nhold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking\\nme too the night in the kitchen i was rolling the potato cake theres\\nsomething i want to say to you only for i put him off letting on i was\\nin a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case i let\\nout too much the night before talking of dreams so i didnt want to let\\nhim know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me\\njosie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and\\nwhen i said i washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did\\nyou wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on\\nthick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on\\nthe indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what\\nspoils him i dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at\\nthat time trying to look like lord byron i said i liked though he\\nwas too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged\\nafterwards though she didnt like it so much the day i was in fits of\\nlaughing with the giggles i couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling\\nout one after another with the mass of hair i had youre always in great\\nhumour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it\\nmeant because i used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us\\nnot all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault\\nshe didnt darken the door much after we were married i wonder what shes\\ngot like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her\\nface beginning to look drawn and run down the last time i saw her she\\nmust have been just after a row with him because i saw on the moment she\\nwas edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him\\nto run him down what was it she told me o yes that sometimes he used to\\ngo to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine\\nhaving to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you\\nany moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad poldy\\nanyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes\\nin wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes\\noff his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going\\nabout in his slippers to look for 10000 pounds for a postcard u p up\\no sweetheart may wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to\\nextinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what\\ncould you make of a man like that id rather die 20 times over than marry\\nanother of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to\\nput up with him the way i do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows\\nthat too at the bottom of his heart take that mrs maybrick that poisoned\\nher husband for what i wonder in love with some other man yes it was\\nfound out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing\\nlike that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad\\nand always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them\\nfor if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on\\nwithout us white arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it i\\nwonder why they call it that if i asked him hed say its from the greek\\nleave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with\\nthe other fellow to run the chance of being hanged o she didnt care if\\nthat was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough\\nto go and hang a woman surely are they\\n\\ntheyre all so different boylan talking about the shape of my foot he\\nnoticed at once even before he was introduced when i was in the d b c\\nwith poldy laughing and trying to listen i was waggling my foot we both\\nordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter i saw him looking with his\\ntwo old maids of sisters when i stood up and asked the girl where it was\\nwhat do i care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches\\nhe made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all\\nmyself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one i\\ndid i forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that i never got after\\nsome robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the irish times\\nlost in the ladies lavatory d b c dame street finder return to mrs\\nmarion bloom and i saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning\\ndoor he was looking when i looked back and i went there for tea 2 days\\nafter in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because i was\\ncrossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes\\nthat are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if i only had a\\nring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine ill stick him for one\\nand a gold bracelet i dont like my foot so much still i made him spend\\nonce with my foot the night after goodwins botchup of a concert so cold\\nand windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire\\nwasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the\\nhearthrug in lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots\\nhed like me to walk in all the horses dung i could find but of course\\nhes not natural like the rest of the world that i what did he say i\\ncould give 9 points in 10 to katty lanner and beat her what does that\\nmean i asked him i forget what he said because the stoppress edition\\njust passed and the man with the curly hair in the lucan dairy thats so\\npolite i think i saw his face before somewhere i noticed him when i was\\ntasting the butter so i took my time bartell darcy too that he used to\\nmake fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after i\\nsang gounods _ave maria_ what are we waiting for o my heart kiss me\\nstraight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot\\nfor all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if\\nyou can believe him i liked the way he used his mouth singing then he\\nsaid wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that i dont see\\nanything so terrible about it ill tell him about that some day not now\\nand surprise him ay and ill take him there and show him the very place\\ntoo we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing\\ncan happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we\\nwere engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was\\nlo times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off\\nmy drawers that was the evening coming along kenilworth square he kissed\\nme in the eye of my glove and i had to take it off asking me questions\\nis it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so i let him keep it\\nas if i forgot it to think of me when i saw him slip it into his pocket\\nof course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen\\nalways skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their\\nskirts blowing up to their navels even when milly and i were out with\\nhim at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right\\nagainst the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me\\nfrom behind following in the rain i saw him before he saw me however\\nstanding at the corner of the harolds cross road with a new raincoat on\\nhim with the muffler in the zingari colours to show off his complexion\\nand the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there\\nwhere hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from\\nanything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but\\nthey want to know where were you where are you going i could feel him\\ncoming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping\\naway from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so i\\nhalfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till i took off my\\nglove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for\\nthe rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers\\nthe whole blessed time till i promised to give him the pair off my doll\\nto carry about in his waistcoat pocket _o maria santisima_ he did look\\na big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me\\nhungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat\\ni had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel\\ndown in the wet if i didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new\\nraincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so\\nsavage for it if anyone was passing so i lifted them a bit and touched\\nhis trousers outside the way i used to gardner after with my ring hand\\nto keep him from doing worse where it was too public i was dying to find\\nout was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want\\nto do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father\\nwaiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say i left my purse in\\nthe butchers and had to go back for it what a deceiver then he wrote me\\nthat letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any\\nwoman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met\\nasking me have i offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw i\\nwasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool henny doyle he was\\nalways breaking or tearing something in the charades i hate an unlucky\\nman and if i knew what it meant of course i had to say no for form sake\\ndont understand you i said and wasnt it natural so it is of course\\nit used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in\\ngibraltar with that word i couldnt find anywhere only for children\\nseeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice\\na day i liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman\\nwhen he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then i wrote\\nthe night he kissed my heart at dolphins barn i couldnt describe it\\nsimply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to\\nembrace well like gardner i hope hell come on monday as he said at the\\nsame time four i hate people who come at all hours answer the door you\\nthink its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or\\nthe door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface\\ngoodwin called about the concert in lombard street and i just after\\ndinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me\\nprofessor i had to say im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his\\nway it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you\\nhave to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today i thought\\nit was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and i\\nwas just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a\\nfool of me when i knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been\\na bit late because it was l/4 after 3 when i saw the 2 dedalus girls\\ncoming from school i never know the time even that watch he gave me\\nnever seems to go properly id want to get it looked after when i threw\\nthe penny to that lame sailor for england home and beauty when i was\\nwhistling there is a charming girl i love and i hadnt even put on my\\nclean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go\\nto belfast just as well he has to go to ennis his fathers anniversary\\nthe 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel\\nwere beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed i couldnt\\ntell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps\\nsome protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed\\nnever believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a\\nhusband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did\\nanything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where\\nhe is besides something always happens with him the time going to the\\nmallow concert at maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of\\nus then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup\\nsplashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter\\nafter him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the\\nengine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen\\nin the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so\\npigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was\\nable to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on\\nto cork i suppose that was done out of revenge on him o i love jaunting\\nin a train or a car with lovely soft cushions i wonder will he take\\na 1st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the\\nguard well o i suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at\\nus with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an\\nexceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage\\nthat day going to howth id like to find out something about him l or 2\\ntunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer\\nthen coming back suppose i never came back what would they say eloped\\nwith him that gets you on on the stage the last concert i sang at where\\nits over a year ago when was it st teresas hall clarendon st little\\nchits of missies they have now singing kathleen kearney and her like\\non account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded\\nbeggar and wearing a brooch for lord roberts when i had the map of it\\nall and poldy not irish enough was it him managed it this time i wouldnt\\nput it past him like he got me on to sing in the _stabat mater_ by going\\naround saying he was putting lead kindly light to music i put him up to\\nthat till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano\\nlead thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about\\nwith some of them sinner fein lately or whatever they call themselves\\ntalking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed\\nme without the neck is very intelligent the coming man griffiths is he\\nwell he doesnt look it thats all i can say still it must have been him\\nhe knew there was a boycott i hate the mention of their politics after\\nthe war that pretoria and ladysmith and bloemfontein where gardner lieut\\nstanley g 8th bn 2nd east lancs rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely\\nfellow in khaki and just the right height over me im sure he was brave\\ntoo he said i was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock\\nmy irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be\\nseen from the road he couldnt stand properly and i so hot as i never\\nfelt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom paul\\nand the rest of the other old krugers go and fight it out between them\\ninstead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were\\nwith their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so\\nbad i love to see a regiment pass in review the first time i saw the\\nspanish cavalry at la roque it was lovely after looking across the bay\\nfrom algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham\\nbattles on the 15 acres the black watch with their kilts in time at the\\nmarch past the 10th hussars the prince of wales own or the lancers o the\\nlancers theyre grand or the dublins that won tugela his father made his\\nmoney over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a\\nnice present up in belfast after what i gave him theyve lovely linen up\\nthere or one of those nice kimono things i must buy a mothball like i\\nhad before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going\\nround with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave\\nthis ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the\\nknuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or\\ntell the police on me but theyd think were married o let them all go and\\nsmother themselves for the fat lot i care he has plenty of money and hes\\nnot a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if i could find\\nout whether he likes me i looked a bit washy of course when i looked\\nclose in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression\\nbesides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big\\nhipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having\\nto lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way\\nmrs mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and\\nstick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild\\nwith his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes\\nthem lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks\\nwith the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly well off i know by\\nthe cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect\\ndevil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up\\nthe tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20 quid he said he lost\\nover that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of\\nlenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making\\nfree with me after the glencree dinner coming back that long joult over\\nthe featherbed mountain after the lord mayor looking at me with his\\ndirty eyes val dillon that big heathen i first noticed him at dessert\\nwhen i was cracking the nuts with my teeth i wished i could have picked\\nevery morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty\\nand browned and as tender as anything only for i didnt want to eat\\neverything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked\\nsilver too i wish i had some i could easily have slipped a couple into\\nmy muff when i was playing with them then always hanging out of them for\\nmoney in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to\\nbe thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be\\nnoticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on i\\nwant at least two other good chemises for one thing and but i dont know\\nwhat kind of drawers he likes none at all i think didnt he say yes and\\nhalf the girls in gibraltar never wore them either naked as god made\\nthem that andalusian singing her manola she didnt make much secret of\\nwhat she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered\\nafter one days wear i could have brought them back to lewers this\\nmorning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to\\nupset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole\\nthing and one of those kidfitting corsets id want advertised cheap in\\nthe gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one i have\\nbut thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line\\n11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to\\nreduce flesh my belly is a bit too big ill have to knock off the\\nstout at dinner or am i getting too fond of it the last they sent from\\norourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy larry they\\ncall him the old mangy parcel he sent at xmas a cottage cake and a\\nbottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get\\nanyone to drink god spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or\\ni must do a few breathing exercises i wonder is that antifat any good\\nmight overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters\\nthat much i have the violet pair i wore today thats all he bought me\\nout of the cheque he got on the first o no there was the face lotion\\ni finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new i told him\\nover and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget\\nit god only knows whether he did after all i said to him 111 know by\\nthe bottle anyway if not i suppose 111 only have to wash in my piss like\\nbeeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet i thought\\nit was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much\\nfiner where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity\\nit isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about 6/- in all\\nsure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and\\nrent when i get it ill lash it around i tell you in fine style i always\\nwant to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if\\ni buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes how\\nmuch were they ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and\\njacket and the one at the cleaners 3 whats that for any woman cutting\\nup this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and\\nwomen try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all\\nthe things getting dearer every day for the 4 years more i have of life\\nup to 35 no im what am i at all 111 be 33 in september will i what o\\nwell look at that mrs galbraith shes much older than me i saw her when\\ni was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman\\nmagnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like\\nthat like kitty oshea in grantham street 1st thing i did every morning\\nto look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it\\npity i only got to know her the day before we left and that mrs langtry\\nthe jersey lily the prince of wales was in love with i suppose hes like\\nthe first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all\\nmade the one way only a black mans id like to try a beauty up to what\\nwas she 45 there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what\\nwas it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind\\nof a tin thing round her and the prince of wales yes he had the oyster\\nknife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings\\nme the works of master francois somebody supposed to be a priest about\\na child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for\\nany priest to write and her a--e as if any fool wouldnt know what that\\nmeant i hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards\\nface on him anybody can see its not true and that ruby and fair tyrants\\nhe brought me that twice i remember when i came to page 5 o the part\\nabout where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate\\nsure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he\\ndrinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like\\nthe infant jesus in the crib at inchicore in the blessed virgins arms\\nsure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and i thought\\nfirst it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber\\nwhen she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured h r h\\nhe was in gibraltar the year i was born i bet he found lilies there too\\nwhere he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might\\nhave planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then i wouldnt be here as\\ni am he ought to chuck that freeman with the paltry few shillings\\nhe knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get\\nregular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count\\nthe money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house\\nso you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today i wish hed\\neven smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending\\nto be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in mr\\ncuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up\\ni could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great\\nmirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and\\ntruly mrs bloom only i felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress\\nthat i lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre\\ncoming into fashion again i bought it simply to please him i knew it was\\nno good by the finish pity i changed my mind of going to todd and bums\\nas i said and not lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a\\nlot of trash i hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me\\naltogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and\\ncooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if\\ni went by his advices every blessed hat i put on does that suit me yes\\ntake that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles\\noff my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my\\nbackside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in grafton\\nstreet i had the misfortune to bring him into

spying around as usual on the slip always where he\\nwasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no\\nlove lost between us thats 1 consolation i wonder what kind is that book\\nhe brought me sweets of sin by a gentleman of fashion some other mr de\\nkock i suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his\\ntube from one woman to another i couldnt even change my new white shoes\\nall ruined with the saltwater and the hat i had with that feather all\\nblowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of\\nthe sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in catalan bay\\nround the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens\\nbaskets old luigi near a hundred they said came from genoa and the tall\\nold chap with the earrings i dont like a man you have to climb up to to\\nget at i suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides i dont like\\nbeing alone in this big barracks of a place at night i suppose ill have\\nto put up with it i never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved\\nin the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor\\ndrawingroom with a brassplate or blooms private hotel he suggested go\\nand ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in ennis like\\nall the things he told father he was going to do and me but i saw\\nthrough him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the\\nhoneymoon venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of como he\\nhad a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns o\\nhow nice i said whatever i liked he was going to do immediately if\\nnot sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a\\nleather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving\\nus here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust\\nwith his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to\\nprevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he\\nwas called in lloyds weekly news 20 years in jail then he comes out and\\nmurders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or\\nwhoever she is such a face youd run miles away from i couldnt rest easy\\ntill i bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again\\nbeing locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot\\nor the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor\\nold woman to murder her in her bed id cut them off him so i would not\\nthat hed be much use still better than nothing the night i was sure\\ni heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a\\ncandle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet\\nfrightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could\\nfor the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the lord knows\\nstill its the feeling especially now with milly away such an idea for\\nhim to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account\\nof his grandfather instead of sending her to skerrys academy where shed\\nhave to learn not like me getting all is at school only hed do a thing\\nlike that all the same on account of me and boylan thats why he did\\nit im certain the way he plots and plans everything out i couldnt turn\\nround with her in the place lately unless i bolted the door first gave\\nme the fidgets coming in without knocking first when i put the chair\\nagainst the door just as i was washing myself there below with the glove\\nget on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase\\nwith two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off\\nthat little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before\\nshe left that i got that little italian boy to mend so that you cant\\nsee the join for 2 shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of\\ncourse shes right not to ruin her hands i noticed he was always talking\\nto her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she\\npretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the\\nhouse he cant say i pretend things can he im too honest as a matter of\\nfact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with\\nher its me shed tell not him i suppose he thinks im finished out and\\nlaid on the shelf well im not no nor anything like it well see well see\\nnow shes well on for flirting too with tom devans two sons imitating\\nme whistling with those romps of murray girls calling for her can milly\\ncome out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her\\nround in nelson street riding harry devans bicycle at night its as well\\nhe sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to\\ngo on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose i\\nsmelt it off her dress when i was biting off the thread of the button\\ni sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me i\\ntell you only i oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a\\nparting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out\\nno matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste\\nyour blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle\\nblackbottom and i had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on\\nshow on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at\\nher like me when i was her age of course any old rag looks well on\\nyou then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the only way in the\\ntheatre royal take your foot away out of that i hate people touching\\nme afraid of her life id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that\\ntouching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always\\ntrying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the gaiety for\\nbeerbohm tree in trilby the last time ill ever go there to be squashed\\nlike that for any trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me\\nthere and looking away hes a bit daft i think i saw him after trying to\\nget near two stylishdressed ladies outside switzers window at the same\\nlittle game i recognised him on the moment the face and everything but\\nhe didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the\\nbroadstone going away well i hope shell get someone to dance attendance\\non her the way i did when she was down with the mumps and her glands\\nswollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything\\ndeep yet i never came properly till i was what 22 or so it went into the\\nwrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that\\nconny connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with\\nsealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he\\nlooked so handsome then we had martin harvey for breakfast dinner and\\nsupper i thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man\\ngives up his life for her that way for nothing i suppose there are a\\nfew men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really\\nhappened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their\\nnatures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that\\nwould feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the\\nhead his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself\\nafter her still poor old man i suppose he felt lost shes always making\\nlove to my things too the few old rags i have wanting to put her hair up\\nat i s my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that\\nall her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her\\nlips so red a pity they wont stay that way i was too but theres no use\\ngoing to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when\\ni asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met mrs joe\\ngallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her\\ntrap with friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till i gave her 2\\ndamn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering\\nme like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of\\ncourse contradicting i was badtempered too because how was it there was\\na weed in the tea or i didnt sleep the night before cheese i ate was it\\nand i told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that\\nbecause she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he\\ndoesnt correct her faith i will that was the last time she turned on the\\nteartap i was just like that myself they darent order me about the place\\nits his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of\\ngetting in a woman long ago am i ever going to have a proper servant\\nagain of course then shed see him coming id have to let her know or shed\\nrevenge it arent they a nuisance that old mrs fleming you have to be\\nwalking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and\\nfarting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good\\njob i found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the\\ndresser i knew there was something and opened the area window to let out\\nthe smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he\\nwalked

hole in his\\nsock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those\\nprizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing\\nover the railings if anybody saw him that

omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways i\\nwouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or god knows what else\\nstill i liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so\\nsevere his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap o\\nanything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot\\nthat of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters\\nmy precious one everything connected with your glorious body everything\\nunderlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever\\nsomething he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at\\nmyself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and i said i hadnt are you sure\\no yes i said i am quite sure in a way that shut him up i knew what was\\ncoming next only natural weakness it was he excited me i dont know how\\nthe first night ever we met when i was living in rehoboth terrace we\\nstood staring at one another for about lo minutes as if we met somewhere\\ni suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used\\nto amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him\\nand all the doyles said he was going to stand for a member of parliament\\no wasnt i the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule\\nand the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the\\nhuguenots to sing in french to be more classy o beau pays de la touraine\\nthat i never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion\\nand persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he\\nas a great favour the very 1st opportunity he got a chance in brighton\\nsquare running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to\\nwash it off with the albion milk and sulphur soap i used to use and the\\ngelatine still round it o i laughed myself sick at him that day i better\\nnot make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a\\nnatural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to\\ndo it i suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits\\nhe has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he\\nwithout a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out\\nall my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that indian god\\nhe took me to show one wet sunday in the museum in kildare street all\\nyellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes\\nsticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and\\nour lords both put together all over asia imitating him as hes always\\nimitating everybody i suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed\\ntoo with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking\\nthing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes i know i hope the old\\npress doesnt creak ah i knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time\\nsomewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of\\ncourse he has to pay for it from her o this nuisance of a thing i hope\\ntheyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves\\nup god help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly\\nbed always reminds me of old cohen i suppose he scratched himself in it\\noften enough and he thinks father bought it from lord napier that i used\\nto admire when i was a little girl because i told him easy piano o\\ni like my bed god here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many\\nhouses were we in at all raymond terrace and ontario terrace and lombard\\nstreet

hotel worse\\nand worse says warden daly that charming place on the landing always\\nsomebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them\\nalways know who was in there last every time were just getting on right\\nsomething happens or he puts his big foot in it thoms and helys and mr\\ncuffes and drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old\\nlottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives\\nimpudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the\\nfreeman too like the rest on account of those sinner fein or the\\nfreemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling\\nalong in the wet all by himself round by coadys lane will give him much\\nconsolation that he says is so capable and sincerely irish he is indeed\\njudging by the sincerity of the trousers i saw on him wait theres\\ngeorges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour l wait 2 oclock well\\nthats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody\\nclimbing down into the area if anybody saw him ill knock him off that\\nlittle habit tomorrow first ill look at his shirt to see or ill see if\\nhe has that french letter still in his pocketbook i suppose he thinks i\\ndont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their lies\\nthen why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you\\nthen tucked up in bed like those babies in the aristocrats masterpiece\\nhe brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life\\nwithout some old aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more\\nwith those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the\\nkind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in\\ntheir empty heads they ought to get slow

dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail\\nto sing out of in holles street squeezed and squashed into them and\\ngrinning all over his big dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty\\ndidnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a\\nspectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the preserved seats for\\nthat to see him trotting off in his trowlers and simon dedalus too he\\nwas always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the\\nold love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the\\nhawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when i sang maritana\\nwith him at freddy mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious\\nvoice phoebe dearest goodbye _sweet_heart sweetheart he always sang it\\nnot like bartell darcy sweet tart goodbye of course he had the gift of\\nthe voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath\\no maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too\\nhigh for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to\\nmay goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of\\nit hes a widower now i wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author\\nand going to be a university professor of italian and im to take lessons\\nwhat is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me i\\nought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion\\nstill i look young in it i wonder he didnt make him a present of it\\naltogether and me too after all why not i saw him driving down to the\\nkingsbridge station with his father and mother i was in mourning thats\\n11 years ago now yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into\\nmourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was\\nenough for me i heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course\\nhe insisted hed go into mourning for the cat i suppose hes a man now by\\nthis time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his\\nlord fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when i\\nsaw him at mat dillons he liked me too i remember they all do wait by\\ngod yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when i laid\\nout the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met\\nbefore i thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either\\nbesides

a rise\\nin society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look\\nat that and didnt i dream something too yes there was something about\\npoetry in it i hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or\\nstanding up like a red indian what do they go about like that for only\\ngetting themselves and their poetry laughed at i always liked poetry\\nwhen i was a girl first i thought he was a poet like lord byron and not\\nan ounce of it in his composition i thought he was quite different i\\nwonder is he too young hes about wait 88 i was married 88 milly is 15\\nyesterday 89 what age was he then at dillons 5 or 6 about 88 i suppose\\nhes 20 or more im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 i hope hes not\\nthat stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting\\ndown in the old kitchen with him taking eppss cocoa and talking of\\ncourse he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was\\nout of trinity college hes very young to be a professor i hope hes not\\na professor like goodwin was he was a potent professor of john jameson\\nthey all write about some woman in their poetry well i suppose he wont\\nfind many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where\\npoetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully\\ncoming back on the nightboat from tarifa the lighthouse at europa point\\nthe guitar that fellow played was so expressive will i ever go back\\nthere again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid ill sing that\\nfor him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly\\nbright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star\\nitll be a change the lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk\\nto about yourself not always listening to him and billy prescotts ad\\nand keyess ad and tom the devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their\\nbusiness we have to suffer im sure hes very distinguished id like to\\nmeet a man like that god not those other ruck besides hes young those\\nfine young men i could see down in margate strand bathingplace from the\\nside of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a god or something\\nand then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that\\nthered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he\\nbought i could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders\\nhis finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you\\ni often felt i wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock\\nthere so simple i wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was\\nlooking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks\\nwith his boyish face i would too in 1/2 a minute even if some of it went\\ndown what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed\\nbe so clean compared with those pigs of men i suppose never dream of\\nwashing it from i years end to the other the most of them only thats\\nwhat gives the women the moustaches im sure itll be grand if i can only\\nget in with a handsome young poet at my age ill throw them the 1st thing\\nin the morning till i see if the wishcard comes out or ill try pairing\\nthe lady herself and see if he comes out ill read and study all i can\\nfind or learn a bit off by heart if i knew who he likes so he wont think\\nme stupid if he thinks all women are the same and i can teach him the\\nother part ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under\\nme then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our 2\\nphotographs in all the papers when he becomes famous o but then what am\\ni going to do about him though\\n\\nno thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no\\nnothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because\\ni didnt call him hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a\\ncabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place\\npulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so\\nbarefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar\\nway in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a\\nbutcher or those old hypocrites in the time of julius caesar of course\\nhes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might\\nas well be in bed with what with a lion god im sure hed have something\\nbetter to say for himself an old lion would o well i suppose its because\\nthey were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist\\nthey excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure\\nthey get off a womans body were so round and white for them always i\\nwished i was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they\\nhave swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you\\ntouch it my uncle john has a thing long i heard those cornerboys saying\\npassing the comer of marrowbone lane my aunt mary has a thing hairy\\nbecause it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me\\nblush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long\\ninto my aunt marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle\\nin a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they\\nplease a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different\\ntastes like those houses round behind irish street no but were to be\\nalways chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear\\nonce i start i tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we\\nall remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it\\nout what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it\\nhes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the

and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the irs.\\n\\nthe foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united\\nstates.  compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  we do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  to\\nsend donations or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\n\\nwhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\ninternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the united states.  u.s. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nplease check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\nto donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\n\\n\\nsection 5.  general information about project gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nprofessor michael s. hart is the originator of the project gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  for thirty years, he produced and distributed project\\ngutenberg-tm ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\n\\nproject gutenberg-tm ebooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as public domain in the u.s.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\n\\nmost people start at our web site which has the main pg search facility:\\n\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nthis web site includes information about project gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the project gutenberg literary\\narchive foundation, how to help produce our new ebooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new ebooks.\\n'"
